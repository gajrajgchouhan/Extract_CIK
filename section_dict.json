            "\u00b0Item 1. BUSINESS</div><div></div><div>Overview </div><div></div><div>We are a leading provider of secure application solutions and services that enable a new generation of intelligently connected companies with the ability to continuously improve cyber protection and digital responsiveness across dynamic Information Technology (IT) and network infrastructures. Our portfolio of software and hardware solutions combines industry-leading performance and scale with advanced intelligent automation, machine learning, data driven analytics, and threat intelligence to ensure security and availability of customer applications across their multi-cloud networks, including on-premise, private and public clouds. As the cyber threat landscape intensifies and network architectures evolve, we are committed to providing customers with greater connected intelligence to improve the security, visibility, availability, flexibility, management and performance of their applications. Our customers include leading cloud providers, web-scale businesses, service providers, government organizations, and enterprises.</div><div></div><div>Industry Trends &amp; Market Drivers</div><div></div><div>The digitization of business has made applications a critical ingredient in virtually every aspect of operations. How safely and efficiently applications perform determines how businesses perform, how they compete, grow, and stand out in the marketplace. The application networking industry is experiencing dynamic shifts in the way applications are developed, delivered, monetized and protected. Our corporate strategy and technology address these evolving needs of our customers and industry, including:</div><div></div><div>Increased Adoption of Cloud Applications. For decades, businesses operated with applications based in physical, appliance-based data centers. While these traditional applications remain central to businesses around the world, a new genre of cloud-based applications is emerging, presenting new opportunities and challenges that require organizations to reassess the visibility, performance and security of their applications. Some of these challenges relate to how a business effectively manages secure application services across various data centers and cloud types - whether private, public or hybrid clouds. Over time, more and more applications may be born in the cloud, while some applications that existed in traditional data centers may migrate to clouds as well. To address this shift, businesses will need solutions that bridge both traditional and cloud-based application environments and centrally manage all secure application services holistically in this multi-cloud world. </div><div></div><div>Increased Network Complexity and New Infrastructure ParadigmsTraditional IT vendors may need to shift from hardware-centric models to software-defined approaches to improve agility for critical applications, and subsequently, their business operations. Ensuring product portfolios adapt and diversify to include traditional hardware as well as newer software and cloud-based offerings are key factors determining future market leadership and competitive landscapes.   </div><div></div><div>Growing Importance of Automation and Orchestration.As applications increasingly move to a multi-cloud environment, the deployment of orchestration and automation tools has become essential to efficiently automating the  deployment and operations of security and application services. There is a need for increased operational efficiency and agility, improved detection and reporting of security anomalies, enhanced end-user experiences and reduced total cost of ownership (TCO), simplified management of distributed application services, improved capacity planning and optimized multi-cloud software lifecycle management. By deploying newly developed secure application delivery automation and analytics tools, enterprises are able to visualize their application performance and to detect anomalous trends. </div><div></div><div>The Rise of DDoS Attacks. The cyberthreat landscape continues to intensify and grow. Malicious actors andcybercriminals such as hacktivists, amateur hackers, and foreign military and intelligence organizations target data centers of every type. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are increasing in size, frequency, complexity and notoriety. IT defenders are faced with the increasing sophistication of adversaries who are responsible for the size and frequency of these attacks. According to the A10 Networks Application Intelligence Report (AIR), 44% percent of the IT professionals surveyed in January 2018 expect DDoS attacks to increase over the next year, and 70 percent expect overall cyberattacks to increase or remain the same. </div><div></div><div>A DDoS attack seeks to render a target network or website unavailable by orchestrating coordinated attacks from massive worldwide networks of compromised endpoints, called botnets. Compromised endpoints can be computing </div><div></div><div><div>4</div></div><div></div><div>devices or Internet of Things driven devices like video cameras. Any internet-connected device can be vulnerable to hackers and utilized as part of a botnet.  </div><div></div><div>Rapid growth of SSL, encrypted applications, and hidden threats. Many applications use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Cyber criminals exploit the protocol to hide malicious malware within encrypted channels and carry out attacks against businesses and users. This malicious trend drives demand for greater visibility within SSL-encrypted channels. Businesses need a way to decrypt traffic and apply outbound security policies efficiently, and require an effective way to inspect, identify, and remediate malicious traffic, then re-encrypt traffic and deliver it quickly to its destination. Conducting this process efficiently without placing a security performance tax on the user experience is a critical requirement. </div><div></div><div>Rapid Growth of Internet-Connected Devices and the Exhaustion of the Existing IP Address Space. The rapid growth of mobile and other internet-connected devices threatens to overwhelm the current Internet Protocol (IP) addressing scheme, IPv4. This Internet of Things trend, combined with mobility and widespread access to the internet globally, all feed each other. Supporting the rapid growth of internet-connected devices requires application networking technology to play a significant role in managing two internet connection standards simultaneously, extending the viability of IPv4 while enabling customers to move to IPv6. As new trends like 5G emerge in coming years, the need for IPv4 preservation and IPv6 transition may increase in importance.</div><div></div><div>Need for Advanced Secure Application Service Solutions. To address these challenges, advanced and integrated solutions for managing secure application services across businesses application environments are needed. Of the many solution requirements, some of the more critical include:</div><div></div><div>Ability to Centrally Manage Traditional and Cloud Environments. As more applications are born in the cloud, and they operate alongside traditional applications supported by on-premise and appliance-based data centers, application delivery and security solutions will be called upon to span traditional and cloud-based environments. In doing so, solutions must centrally control and manage secure application services across any combination of traditional data centers and clouds. To support data centers and different cloud types, solutions require a variety of form factors; hardware, software (i.e. virtual, bare metal) and cloud-based offerings.</div><div></div><div>ClearVisibility andSophisticatedAnalytics. The effectiveness of application performance and security depends greatly on the level of visibility a business has into its application traffic. That visibility must be able to span any number of data centers and cloud types to ensure a holistic view of security threats and performance issues affecting applications. The deeper and clearer the visibility, the better the analytics and actionable information that can be applied to enhancing application performance and protection. Secure application service solutions must be driven by solid visibility and per-app analytics.</div><div></div><div>Ability to Scale. Performance and security at scale are paramount in todays dynamic application environments. Solutions need to analyze application traffic quickly and enhance performance and security in traditional and cloud-based application environments in a centrally managed manner.</div><div></div><div>Sophisticated Security Functionality. Secure application service solutions must detect and mitigate sophisticated cybersecurity threats, such as malicious threats hiding in encrypted traffic and DDoS attacks. To defend against the rising volume of sophisticated cyber-attacks, solutions require exceptional performance and scale without dramatically increasing footprint and total cost of ownership.</div><div></div><div>Product Portfolio</div><div></div><div>Our product portfolio seeks to address many of the aforementioned challenges and solution requirements. The portfolio consists of six secure application solutions and two intelligent management and automation tools.</div><div></div><div>While our revenue to date has been predominantly hardware-based, software and cloud-based solutions are becoming an increasingly important part of the solutions portfolio.

The value and significance of our high-performance offerings reside in our portfolios underlying software operating system. With the exception of Lightning ADC, our products are built on the Advanced Core Operating System (ACOS) platform and leverage its performance optimization and security features.</div><div></div><div>The ACOS platform is optimized for modern 64-bit central processing units (CPUs), which increasingly have multiple parallel processing cores that operate within a single CPU for higher efficiency and performance scalability. To maximize the capabilities of these increasingly dense multi-core CPUs, ACOS implements a proprietary shared memory architecture that provides all cores with simultaneous access to common memory. This shared memory software architecture enables our products to utilize these multi-core CPUs efficiently and scale performance with increasing CPU cores. As a result, ACOS provides customers with products that can deliver superior price performance benefits over products that lack these capabilities.</div><div></div><div>ACOS high-performance design enables our products to address a wide range of performance-driven networking challenges. The flexible software design of ACOS allows us to apply our portfolio to a variety of markets for a variety of needs. Some notable details about ACOS include:</div><div></div><div>High Performance and Intelligent Network I/O Processing. In order to maximize the efficiency of high density, multi-core processors, we have developed a high performance intelligent network I/O technology that can balance application traffic flows equitably across processor cores. Our Flexible Traffic Accelerator logic can be implemented either as software running within a standard x86 processor or a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) semiconductor. Our Flexible Traffic Accelerator (FTA) also performs certain hardware-based security checks for each packet and can discard suspicious traffic before it can impact system performance.</div><div></div><div>Scalable and Efficient Memory Usage. To improve the performance of the multi-core processor architecture, we have developed a shared memory technology to allow all processors to share common memory and the state of the system simultaneously. This avoids the overhead associated with Inter-Processor Communication architectures deployed in first-generation approaches. We optimize memory to be visible to all cores simultaneously, while minimizing communication overhead and contention among processors for allocated memory space. All processors share a common memory pool, which dynamically allocates memory space based on application processing requirements without constraints. Customers can achieve greater performance and scalability from memory and processor resources because configurations, policies and network databases are efficiently stored within a shared memory architecture.</div><div></div><div>Optimized Application Networking and Security. Once data is processed and placed into a shared memory, a processor can begin to apply ACOS common services and function-specific logic. To ensure that every processor is utilized to perform every function and thereby achieve greater system utilization, ACOS uses all processor cores symmetrically for all functions and services. The ACOS common services perform a set of key operational functions, including configuration management, network I/O, aFleX scripting, Virtual Chassis System(aVCS), aXAPI for management integration, Application Delivery Partitions (ADPs), virtualization to enable multi-tenancy, and common resource management such as buffer, system memory, timer management and other internal system management tasks. ACOS features a modular software design, which improves reliability by ensuring that modifications made to one module will not have unwanted side effects on other system functions.</div><div></div><div>Other noteworthy ACOS Technologies. ACOS incorporates a number of other technologies to provide a rich environment for developing Layer 4-7 application networking solutions, including:</div><div></div><div>aFleX Scripting. aFleX scripting technology is based on industry-standard tool command language and enables customers to write custom scripts to augment the application processing.</div><div></div><div>ADP. ADP enables multi-tenancy in the ACOS common services so that multiple departments of an organization or multiple customers can share a physical/virtual appliance.</div><div></div><div>aVCS. aVCS enables multiple physical/virtual appliances to be managed as a single chassis.</div><div></div><div><div>8</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>aXAPI. aXAPI is an industry standard representational state transfer (RESTful) program interface to enable management integration for automated management.</div><div></div><div>Support &amp; Services</div><div></div><div>One of our founding principles is to provide excellent customer support. Our global support team is part of our engineering organization and is trained across all products and solutions, and takes complete ownership of customer issues from the beginning to the end to achieve rapid response and resolution.

For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>11</div></div><div></div><div>For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, our total revenue was $235.4 million,  $227.3 millionand $196.3 million, respectively, representing growth of 20%from 2015to 2017. Our total revenue grew 16%in 2016as compared to 2015and grew 4%in 2017as compared to 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, our gross margin was 77.4%, 76.1%and 75.3%, respectively. We had net losses of $10.8 million, $22.4 millionand $41.9 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, respectively.</div><div></div><div>Intellectual Property </div><div></div><div>We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December31, 2017, we had 107United States (U.S.) patents issued and 63U.S. patent applications pending, and 53overseas patents issued and 32overseas patent applications pending. Our issued U.S. patents, excluding 22patents that we acquired, expire between 2025and 2036. Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. </div><div></div><div>We license software from third parties for development of or integration into our products, including proprietary and open source software. We pursue registration of our trademarks and domain names in the United States and other jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 1A.

            "\u00b0Item1A. RISK FACTORS</div><div></div><div>Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this report, and in our other public filings. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects could be materially harmed. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, perhaps significantly.</div><div></div><div>We have identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017. If we fail to properly remediate these or any future material weaknesses or deficiencies or to maintain proper and effective internal controls, material misstatements in our financial statements could occur and impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements and could adversely affect investor confidence in our financial reports, which could negatively affect our business.</div><div></div><div>As described inItem 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017, due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. While we have initiated remediation efforts to address the identified weaknesses, we cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective as of December 31, 2018. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future. We intend to continue our control remediation activities and generally improve our internal controls. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management time on compliance-related issues.</div><div></div><div>If our remediation measures are insufficient to address the identified deficiencies, or if additional deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal controls may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to further regulatory investigations and penalties or stockholder litigation, and materially adversely impact our business and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>TheAudit Committees investigation of certain accounting and internal control matters relating to our current and previously issued financial statements and the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the</div><div>year ended December 31, 2017 have been time-consuming and expensive, and may result in additional expense.</div><div></div><div>We have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the Audit Committees internal investigation, the review of our accounting, the audit of our 2017 financial statements and the ongoing remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have taken a number of steps in order to strengthen our accounting function and attempt to reduce the risk of future recurrence and errors in accounting determinations. The validation of the efficacy of these remedial steps will result in us incurring near term expenses, and to the extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur significant additional time and expense. The incurrence of significant additional expense, or the requirement that management devote significant time that could reduce the time available to execute on our business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Our failure to timely file periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 could adversely affect the market for our common stock and make it more difficult for us to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.</div><div></div><div>We are filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K approximately five months after it was due. Because of the time required to complete and file this report, we also were unable to timely file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 (the 2018 Form 10-Qs). </div><div></div><div></div><div><div>13</div></div><div></div><div>As previously disclosed, we received on April 3, 2018 a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) indicating that we were not in compliance with the NYSEs continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria outlined in Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of the delay in filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we are filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K within the NYSEs six-month period to cure the filing delinquency, we have not filed the 2018 Form 10-Qs and, therefore, remain not in compliance with the NYSEs continued listing requirements, which subjects us to the risk of delisting. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could have a significant negative effect on the value and liquidity of our common stock, may preclude us from using exemptions from certain state and federal securities regulations, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.</div><div></div><div>In addition, as a result of our inability to timely file our periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will not be eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to conduct public offerings of our securities until we have timely filed all periodic reports with the SEC for a period of twelve months. Our inability to use Form S-3 during this time period may have a negative impact on our ability to access the public capital markets in a timely fashion because we would be required to file a long-form registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. This may limit our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity.</div><div></div><div>If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities or if the market does not continue to adopt our application networking products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.</div><div></div><div>The application networking market is rapidly evolving and difficult to predict. Technologies, customer requirements, security threats and industry standards are constantly changing. As a result, we must anticipate future market needs and opportunities and then develop new products or enhancements to our current products that are designed to address those needs and opportunities, and we may not be successful in doing so.</div><div></div><div>Even if we are able to anticipate, develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements that address the markets needs and opportunities, there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance. For example, organizations that use other conventional or first-generation application networking products for their needs may believe that these products are sufficient. In addition, as we launch new product offerings, organizations may not believe that such new product offerings offer any additional benefits as compared to the existing application networking products that they currently use. Accordingly, organizations may continue allocating their IT budgets for existing application networking products and may not adopt our products, regardless of whether our products can offer superior performance or security.</div><div></div><div>If we fail to anticipate market needs and opportunities or if the market does not continue to adopt our application networking products, then market acceptance and sales of our current and future application networking products could be substantially decreased or delayed, we could lose customers, and our revenue may not grow or may decline. Any of such events would significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>Our success depends on our timely development of new products and features to address rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements. If we are unable to timely develop and successfully introduce new products and features that adequately address these changes and requirements, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>Changes in application software technologies, data center and communications hardware, networking software and operating systems, and industry standards, as well as our end-customers continuing business growth, result in evolving application networking needs and requirements. Our continued success depends on our ability to identify, develop and introduce in a timely and successful manner, new products and new features for our existing products that meet these needs and requirements.</div><div></div><div>Our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities. Developing our products and related enhancements is time-consuming and expensive. We have made significant investments in our research and development team in order to address these product development needs. Our investments in research and development may not result in significant design and performance improvements or marketable products or features, or may result in products that are more expensive than anticipated. We may take longer to generate revenue, or generate less revenue, than we anticipate from our new products and product enhancements. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>14</div></div><div></div><div>If we are unable to develop new products and features to address technological changes and new customer requirements in the application networking market or if our investments in research and development do not yield the expected benefits in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>We have experienced net losses in recent periods, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. If we cannot achieve or maintain profitability, our financial performance will be harmed and our business may suffer.</div><div></div><div>We experienced net losses for the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015. Although we experienced revenue growth over these periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase our revenue growth or achieve profitability in the future or on a consistent basis. During the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015, we have invested in our sales, marketing and research and development teams in order to develop, market and sell our products. We may continue to invest in these areas in the future. As a result of these expenditures, we may have to generate and sustain increased revenue, manage our cost structure and avoid significant liabilities to achieve future profitability. </div><div></div><div>Revenue growth may slow or decline, and we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including our inability to develop products that achieve market acceptance, general economic conditions, increasing competition, decreased growth in the markets in which we operate, or our failure for any reason to capitalize on growth opportunities. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline.</div><div></div><div>Our operating results have varied and are likely to continue to vary significantly from period to period and may be unpredictable, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.</div><div></div><div>Our operating results, in particular, revenue, margins and operating expenses, have fluctuated in the past, and we expect this will continue, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. The timing and size of sales of our products are highly variable and difficult to predict and can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue from period to period. This is particularly true of sales to our largest end-customers, such as service providers, Web giants and governmental organizations, who typically make large and concentrated purchases and for whom close or sales cycles can be long, as a result of their complex networks and data centers, as well as requests that may be made for customized features. Our quarterly results may vary significantly based on when these large end-customers place orders with us and the content of their orders.</div><div></div><div>Our operating results may also fluctuate due to a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict. In addition to other risks listed in this Risk Factors section, factors that may affect our operating results include:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>fluctuations in and timing of purchases from, or loss of, large customers;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of end-customers;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>our ability to attract and retain new end-customers;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>changes in demand for our products and services, including seasonal variations in customer spending patterns or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>our reliance on shipments at the end of our quarters;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>variations in product mix or geographic locations of our sales, which can affect the revenue we realize for those sales;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>our ability to increase the size of our distribution channel and to maintain relationships with important distribution channel partners;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>our ability to improve our overall sales productivity and successfully execute our marketing strategies;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div></div><div><div>15</div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the effect of currency exchange rates on our revenue and expenses;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the effect of discounts negotiated by our largest end-customers for sales or pricing pressure from our competitors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>changes in the growth rate of the application networking market or changes in market needs;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>inventory write downs, which may be necessary for our older products when our new products are launched and adopted by our end-customers; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>our third-party manufacturers and component suppliers capacity to meet our product demand forecasts on a timely basis, or at all. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of these factors may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our or our investors or securities analysts revenue, margin or other operating results expectations for a particular period, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.</div><div></div><div>Reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.</div><div></div><div>As a result of end-customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and distribution channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of purchase orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each quarter. We may be able to recognize such revenue in the quarter received, however, only if all of the requirements of revenue recognition are met by the end of the quarter. Any significant interruption in our information technology systems, which manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management, could result in delayed order fulfillment and thus decreased revenue for that quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize (including delays by our customers or potential customers in consummating such purchase orders), our third-party manufacturers inability to manufacture and ship products prior to quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter, our failure to manage inventory to meet demand, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments or achieving specified acceptance criteria, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our, or our investors or securities analysts expectations, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our common stock. </div><div></div><div>We face intense competition in our market, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.</div><div></div><div>The application networking market is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. To the extent that we sell our solutions in adjacent markets, we expect to face intense competition in those markets as well. We believe that our main competitors fall into the following categories:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell products in the traditional ADC market, such as F5 Networks, Inc. (F5 Networks) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (Citrix Systems);</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell open source, software-only, cloud-based ADC services, such as Avi Networks Inc. (Avi Networks), NGINX Inc. (NGiNX), and HAProxy Technologies, Inc. (HAProxy) as well as many startups;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell CGN products, which were originally designed for other networking purposes, such as edge routers and security appliances from vendors like Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco Systems) and Juniper Networks, Inc. (Juniper Networks);</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell traditional DDoS protection products, such as Arbor Networks, Inc., a subsidiary of NetScout Systems, (Arbor Networks) and Radware, Ltd. (Radware):</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div></div><div><div>16</div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell SSL decryption and inspection products, such as Symantec Corporation (through its acquisition of Blue Coat Systems Inc. in 2016) and F5 Networks; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Companies that sell certain network security products, including Secure Web Gateways, SSL Insight/SSL Intercept, data center firewalls and Gi/SGi firewalls. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources and greater name recognition. In addition, some of our larger competitors have broader products offerings and could leverage their customer relationships based on their other products. Potential customers who have purchased products from our competitors in the past may also prefer to continue to purchase from these competitors rather than change to a new supplier regardless of the performance, price or features of the respective products. We could also face competition from new market entrants, which may include our current technology partners. As we continue to expand globally, we may also see new competitors in different geographic regions. Such current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.</div><div></div><div>Many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>longer operating histories; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products and services at a greater range of prices; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the ability to incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products, including through selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or closed technology platforms; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>broader distribution and established relationships with distribution channel partners in a greater number of worldwide locations; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>access to larger end-customer bases; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the ability to use their greater financial resources to attract our research and development engineers as well as other employees of ours; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>larger intellectual property portfolios; and </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a competitive price. We may be required to make substantial additional investments in research and development, marketing and sales in order to respond to competition, and there is no assurance that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. We also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand. Moreover, conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors.</div><div></div><div>In addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available. As a result of these acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization to compete more vigorously or broadly with us. In addition, continued industry consolidation might adversely impact end-customers perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized networking companies and, consequently, end-customers willingness to purchase from companies like us.</div><div></div><div>As a result, increased competition could lead to fewer end-customer orders, price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share.</div><div></div><div>Cloud-based computing trends present competitive and execution risks.</div><div>We are experiencing an industry-wide trend of customers considering transitioning from purely on-premise network architectures to a computing environment that may utilize a mixture of existing solutions and various new cloud-based </div><div></div><div><div>17</div></div><div></div><div>solutions. Concurrently with this transition, pricing and delivery models are also evolving. Many companies in our industry, including some of our competitors, are developing and deploying cloud-based solutions for their customers. In addition, the emergence of new cloud infrastructures may enable new companies to compete with our business. These new competitors may include large cloud providers who can provide their own ADC functionality as well as smaller companies targeting applications that are developed exclusively for delivery in the cloud. We are dedicating significant resources to develop and offer our customers new cloud-based solutions. Also, some of our largest customers are cloud providers that utilize our existing solutions, and we believe that as cloud infrastructures continue to grow our existing solutions may provide benefits to other cloud providers. While we believe our expertise and dedication of resources to developing new cloud-based solutions, together with the benefits that our existing solutions offer cloud providers, represent advantages that provide us with a strong foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our efforts to develop new cloud-based solutions or our efforts to market and sell our existing solutions to cloud providers will attract the customers or generate the revenue necessary to successfully compete in this new business model. Nor is it clear when or in what manner this new business model will evolve, and this uncertainty may delay purchasing decisions by our customers or prospective customers. Whether we are able to successfully compete depends on our execution in a number of areas, includingmaintaining the utility, compatibility and performance of our software on the growing assortment of cloud computing platforms and the enhanced interoperability requirements associated with orchestration of cloud computing environments.Any failure to adapt to these evolving trends may reduce our revenues or operating margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>If we are unable to attract new end-customers, sell additional products to our existing end-customers or achieve the anticipated benefits from our investment in additional sales personnel and resources, our revenue may decline, and our gross margin will be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>To maintain and increase our revenue, we must continually add new end-customers and sell additional products to existing end-customers. The rate at which new and existing end-customers purchase solutions depends on a number of factors, including some outside of our control, such as general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell our solutions to new end-customers and additional solutions to our existing end-customers are not successful, our business and operating results will suffer.</div><div></div><div>In certain recent periods, we have added personnel and other resources to our sales and marketing functions, as we focused on growing our business, entering new markets and increasing our market share. We may incur additional expenses by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and expanding our international operations in order to seek revenue growth. The return on these and future investments may be lower, or may be realized more slowly, than we expect, if realized at all. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our growth rates will decline, and our gross margin would likely be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our business and operating results may be harmed in tangible or intangible ways.</div><div></div><div>We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation are critical to our relationships with, and our ability to attract, new end-customers, technology partners and employees. The successful promotion of our brand will depend largely upon our ability to continue to develop, offer and maintain high-quality products and services, our marketing and public relations efforts, and our ability to differentiate our products and services successfully from those of our competitors. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful and may not yield increased revenue. In addition, extension of our brand to products and uses different from our traditional products and services may dilute our brand, particularly if we fail to maintain the quality of products and services in these new areas. We have in the past, and may in the future, become involved in litigation that could negatively affect our brand. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our growth rate may decline, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors with stronger brands or reputations, and we could lose end-customers or technology partners, all of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>A limited number of our end-customers, including service providers, make large and concentrated purchases that comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Any loss or delay of expected purchases by our largest end-customers could adversely affect our operating results.</div><div></div><div>As a result of the nature of our target market and the current stage of our development, a substantial portion of our revenue in any period comes from a limited number of large end-customers, including service providers.During the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015, purchases from our ten largest end-customers accounted for approximately 35%, 36%and 32%of our total revenue, respectively. The composition of the group of these ten largest end-customers changes from period to period, but often includes service providers, who accounted for approximately 46%, 42%and 44%of our total revenue during the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015, respectively.</div><div></div><div><div>18</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Sales to these large end-customers have typically been characterized by large but irregular purchases with long initial sales cycles. After initial deployment, subsequent purchases of our products typically have a more compressed sales cycle. The timing of these purchases and of the requested delivery of the purchased product is difficult to predict. As a consequence, any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases by or requested deliveries to our largest end-customers could materially affect our revenue and operating results in any quarter and cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.</div><div></div><div>We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase our revenue from our largest end-customers nor that we will be able to offset any absence of significant purchases by our largestend-customersin any particular period with purchases by new or existing end-customers in that or a subsequent period. We expect that sales of our products to a limited number of end-customers will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of, or a significant delay or reduction in purchases by, a small number of end-customers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.</div><div></div><div>Our business could be adversely impacted by changes demanded by our customers in the deployment and payment models for our products.</div><div></div><div>Our customers have traditionally demanded products deployed in physical, appliance-based on-premise data centers that are paid in full at the time of purchase and include perpetual licenses for our software products. While these products remain central to our business, new deployment and payment models are emerging in our industry that may provide some of our customers with additional technical, business agility and flexibility options.These new models include cloud-based applications provided as SaaS and software subscription licenses where license and service fees are ratable and correlate to the type of service used, the quantity of services consumed or the length of time of the subscription. These models have accounting treatments that may require us to recognize revenue ratably over an extended period of time. If a substantial portion of our customers transition from on-premise-based products to such cloud-based, consumption and subscription-based models, this could adversely affect our operating results and could make it more difficult to compare our operating results during such transition period with our historical operating results.</div><div></div><div>Some of our large end-customers demand favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price or other concessions from us. As we seek to sell more products to these end-customers, we may agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business.</div><div></div><div>Some of our large end-customers have significant purchasing power and, accordingly, may request from us and received more favorable terms and conditions, including lower prices than we typically provide. As we seek to sell products to this class of end-customer, we may agree to these terms and conditions, which may include terms that reduce our gross margin and have an adverse effect on our business.</div><div></div><div>Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of products sold, the geographic location of our customers, price discounts offered, required inventory write downs and current exchange rate fluctuations.</div><div></div><div>Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period in response to a number of factors, such as the mix of our products sold and the geographic locations of our sales. Our products tend to have varying gross margins in different geographic regions. We also may offer pricing discounts from time to time as part of a targeted sales campaign or as a result of pricing pressure from our competitors. In addition, our larger end-customers may negotiate pricing discounts in connection with large orders they place with us. The sale of our products at discounted prices could have a negative impact on our gross margin. We also must manage our inventory of existing products when we introduce new products.</div><div></div><div>If we are unable to sell the remaining inventory of our older products prior to or following the launch of such new product offerings, we may be forced to write down inventory for such older products, which could also negatively affect our gross margin. Our gross margin may also vary based on international currency exchange rates. In general, our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, in Japan they are denominated in Japanese yen. Changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen may therefore affect our actual revenue and gross margin.</div><div></div><div>We have been, may presently be, or in the future may be, a party to litigation and claims regarding intellectual property rights, resolution of which has been and may in the future be time-consuming, expensive and adverse to us, as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products non-infringing.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>19</div></div><div></div><div>Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and by increasingly frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of patent and other intellectual property rights. In the ordinary course of our business, we have been and may presently be in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their patents and other claimed intellectual property and proprietary rights. Intellectual property infringement and misappropriation lawsuits and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the complexity of the technical and legal issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or in concluding licenses on reasonable terms or at all.</div><div></div><div>We may have fewer issued patents than some of our major competitors, and therefore may not be able to utilize our patent portfolio effectively to assert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought against us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant products revenue and against which our potential patents may provide little or no deterrence. In addition, many potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources than we can to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of product types and the number of competitors in our market increases. Also, to the extent we gain greater visibility, market exposure and competitive success, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.</div><div></div><div>If we are found in the future to infringe the proprietary rights of others, or if we otherwise settle such claims, we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products such that they no longer infringe. Any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly, time-consuming or impractical. Alternatively, we could also become subject to an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. Any of these claims, regardless of their merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to cease using infringing technology, develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements.</div><div></div><div>Many of our commercial agreements require us to indemnify our end-customers, distributors and resellers for certain third-party intellectual property infringement actions related to our technology, which may require us to defend or otherwise become involved in such infringement claims, and we could incur liabilities in excess of the amounts we have received for the relevant products and/or services from our end-customers, distributors or resellers. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our end-customers, distributors and resellers, may deter future end-customers from purchasing our products or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between an end-customer, distributor or reseller, on the one hand, and a third party, on the other hand, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property rights in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.</div><div></div><div>We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and if we are unable to do so, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.</div><div></div><div>We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, to protect our intellectual property. Despite the efforts we take to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, these efforts may not be sufficient or effective at preventing their unauthorized use. In addition, effective trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost-effective in every country in which we have rights. There may be instances where we are not able to protect intellectual property or other proprietary rights in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights from unauthorized use, the value of those assets may be reduced, which could negatively impact our business.</div><div></div><div>We also rely in part on confidentiality and/or assignment agreements with our technology partners, employees, consultants, advisors and others. These protections and agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and intellectual property information we thought to be proprietary, and in these cases we would not be able to assert any trade secret rights against those parties. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and expensive. We have not made such monitoring a priority to date and will not likely make this a priority in the future. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take will prevent misappropriation of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.</div><div></div><div><div>20</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, even if we protect our intellectual property, we may need to license it to competitors, which could also be harmful. For example, we have already licensed all of our issued patents, pending applications, and future patents and patent applications that we may acquire, obtain, apply for or have a right to license to Brocade until May 2025, for the life of each such patent. In addition, we might incur significant expenses in defending our intellectual property rights. Any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.</div><div></div><div>We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management and technical personnel, as well as cause other claims to be made against us, which might adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect these international sources of our revenue.</div><div></div><div>A significant portion of our revenue is generated in international markets, including Japan, Western Europe, China, Taiwan and South Korea. During the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015, approximately 51%, 49%and 46%of our total revenue, respectively, was generated from customers located outside of the United States. If we are unable to maintain or continue to grow our revenue in these markets, our financial results may suffer.</div><div></div><div>As a result, we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining an international staff, and specifically sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. We also seek to enter into distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. If we are not able to maintain successful distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. Business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the United States and may require us in the future to include terms in customer contracts other than our standard terms. To the extent that we may enter into customer contracts in the future that include non-standard terms, our operating results may be adversely impacted.</div><div></div><div>We have a significant presence in international markets and plan to continue to expand our international operations, which exposes us to a number of risks that could affect our future growth.</div><div></div><div>Our sales team is comprised of field sales and inside sales personnel who are organized by geography and maintain sales presence in 28countries,including in the following countries and regions: United States, Western Europe, the Middle East, Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and Latin America. We expect to continue to increase our sales headcount in all markets, particularly in markets where we currently do not have a sales presence. As we continue to expand our international sales and operations, we are subject to a number of risks, including the following:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and possible longer collection periods;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>greater difficulty in recruiting local experienced personnel, and the costs and expenses associated with such activities;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>economic uncertainty around the world, including continued economic uncertainty as a result of sovereign debt issues in Europe and the United Kingdoms decision to exit the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit);</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div></div><div><div>21</div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification, and localization of our products required in foreign countries;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, and tax laws and treaties;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>greater risk of a failure of foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Because of our worldwide operations, we are also subject to risks associated with compliance with applicable anticorruption laws. One such applicable anticorruption law is the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their employees and intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, securing an advantage, or directing business to another, and requires public companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries, such as channel partners and distributors, fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our results of operations.</div><div></div><div>Our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the most significant exception being Japan, where we invoice primarily in the Japanese yen. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in North America and Japan. Revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that can affect our operating income. The currency exchange impact of the foreign exchange rates on our net loss was $0.4 millionand $1.6 millionunfavorable for the years ended December31, 2017and 2016, respectively. As exchange rates vary, our operating income may differ from expectations. To the extent our foreign currency exposures become more material, we may elect to deploy normal and customary hedging practices designed to more proactively mitigate such exposure. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and would not protect us from long term shifts in currency exchange rates. </div><div></div><div>Our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to hire, retain and motivate qualified product development, sales, marketing and finance personnel.</div><div></div><div>Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, product development, sales, marketing and finance personnel, many of whom may be difficult to replace. The complexity of our products, their integration into existing networks and ongoing support of our products requires us to retain highly trained professional services, customer support and sales personnel with specific expertise related to our business. Competition for qualified professional services, customer support, engineering and sales personnel in our industry is intense, because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products. Our ability to recruit and hire these personnel is harmed by tightening labor markets, particularly in the engineering field, in several of our key geographic hiring areas. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs, nor may we be successful in keeping the qualified personnel we currently have. Our ability to hire and retain these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock, since these employees are generally granted equity-based awards.</div><div></div><div>Our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. In particular, Lee Chen, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Rajkumar Jalan, our Chief Technology Officer, are critical to the development of our technology and the future vision and strategic direction of our company. The loss of services of </div><div></div><div><div>22</div></div><div></div><div>senior management could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.</div><div></div><div>Adverse general economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business.</div><div></div><div>A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for information technology by large enterprises and service providers, the overall economic health of our current and prospective end-customers and the continued growth and evolution of the Internet. The timing of the purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. Volatility in the global economic market or other effects of global or regional economic weakness, including limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, deficit-driven austerity measures that continue to affect governments and educational institutions, and other difficulties may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell our products and services. If economic conditions in the United States, Europe and other key markets for our products continue to be volatile or do not improve or those markets experience another downturn, many end-customers may delay or reduce their IT spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that IT spending levels will increase following any recovery.</div><div>Exposure to UK political developments, including the outcome of the UK referendum on membership in the European Union, could have a material adverse effect on us.</div><div>On June 23, 2016, a referendum was held on the United Kingdoms membership in the European Union, the outcome of which was a vote in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). The Brexit vote creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and potentially across other European Union member states, which may last for a number of months or years.</div><div>The result of the Brexit vote means that the nature of the United Kingdoms long-term relationship with the European Union is unclear and that there is considerable uncertainty as to when any such relationship will be agreed and implemented. In the interim, there is a risk of economic instability for both the United Kingdom and the European Union, which could adversely affect our results, financial condition and prospects.</div><div>The political and economic uncertainty created by the Brexit vote has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and in the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the Euro. Depending on the terms reached regarding any exit from the European Union, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational implications on our business.</div><div>Consequently, no assurance can be given as to the overall impact of the Brexit and, in particular, no assurance can be given that our operating results, financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result.</div><div></div><div>We are dependent on third-party manufacturers, and changes to those relationships, expected or unexpected, may result in delays or disruptions that could harm our business.</div><div></div><div>We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware components to third-party original design manufacturers who assemble these hardware components to our specifications. Our primary manufacturers are Lanner and AEWIN, each of which is located in Taiwan. Our reliance on these third-party manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, and product supply and timing. Any manufacturing disruption at these manufacturers could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders. Our reliance on outsourced manufacturers also may create the potential for infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights or confidential information. If we are unable to manage our relationships with these manufacturers effectively, or if these manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason, experience increased manufacturing lead-times, experience capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our end-customers would be severely impaired, and our business and operating results would be seriously harmed.</div><div></div><div>These manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. We do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms, or the extension of credit limits. Accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, which could result in supply shortages, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. In addition, our orders may represent a relatively small percentage of the overall orders received by our manufacturers from their customers. As a </div><div></div><div><div>23</div></div><div></div><div>result, fulfilling our orders may not be considered a priority by one or more of our manufacturers in the event the manufacturer is constrained in its ability to fulfill all of its customer obligations in a timely manner.</div><div></div><div>Although the services required to manufacture our hardware components may be readily available from a number of established manufacturers, it is time-consuming and costly to qualify and implement such relationships. If we are required to change manufacturers, whether due to an interruption in one of our manufacturers businesses, quality control problems or otherwise, or if we are required to engage additional manufacturers, our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected, which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential customers, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs that could adversely affect our gross margin.</div><div></div><div>Because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.</div><div></div><div>Our products incorporate key components, including certain integrated circuits that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers, including some sole-source providers. In addition, the lead times associated with these and other components of our products can be lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. Moreover, long-term supply and maintenance obligations to our end-customers increase the duration for which specific components are required, which may further increase the risk we may incur component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components in a timely manner for any reason, sales and/or shipments of our products could be delayed or halted, which would seriously affect present and future sales and cause damage to end-customer relationships, which would, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>In addition, our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand, and because we do not necessarily have contracts with these suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components. If we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end-customers or maintain stable pricing, our gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, poor quality in sole-sourced components or certain other components in our products could also result in lost sales or lost sales opportunities. If the quality of such components does not meet our standards or our end-customers requirements, if we are unable to obtain components from our existing suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or if any of our sole source providers cease to continue to manufacture such components or to remain in business, we could be forced to redesign our products and qualify new components from alternate suppliers. The development of alternate sources for those components can be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. Even if we are able to locate alternate sources of supply, we could be forced to pay for expedited shipments of such components or our products at dramatically increased costs.</div><div></div><div>Real or perceived defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products or services or the failure of our products or services to block a threat or prevent a security breach could harm our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations.</div><div></div><div>Because our products and services are complex, they have contained and may contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers. Even if we discover those weaknesses, we may not be able to correct them promptly, if at all. Defects may cause our products to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks, or temporarily interrupt end-customers networking traffic. Furthermore, our products may fail to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats for any number of reasons, including our failure to enhance and expand our platform to reflect industry trends, new technologies and new operating environments, the complexity of the environment of our end-customers and the sophistication of malware, viruses and other threats. Data thieves and hackers are increasingly sophisticated, often affiliated with organized crime or state-sponsored groups, and may operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target. Additionally, as a well-known provider of enterprise security solutions, our networks, products, and services could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. As our products are adopted by an increasing number of enterprises and governments, it is possible that the individuals and organizations behind advanced attacks will focus on finding ways to defeat our products. In addition, defects or errors in our updates to our products could result in a failure of our services to effectively update end-customers products and thereby leave our end-customers vulnerable to attacks. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed end-customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end-customers networks, leaving their networks unprotected against security threats. Our end-customers may also misuse or wrongly configure our products or otherwise fall prey to attacks that our products cannot protect against, which may result in loss or a breach of </div><div></div><div><div>24</div></div><div></div><div>business data, data being inaccessible due to a ransomware attack, or other security incidents. For all of these reasons, we may be unable to anticipate all data security threats or provide a solution in time to protect our end-customers networks. If we fail to identify and respond to new and increasingly complex methods of attack and to update our products to detect or prevent such threats in time to protect our end-customers critical business data, our business, operating results and reputation could suffer.</div><div></div><div>If any companies or governments that are publicly known to use our platform are the subject of a cyberattack that becomes publicized, our other current or potential channel partners or end-customers may look to our competitors for alternatives to our products. Real or perceived security breaches of our end-customers networks could cause disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences and could result in negative publicity to us, damage to our reputation, declining sales, increased expenses and end-customer relations issues. To the extent potential end-customers or industry analysts believe that the occurrence of any actual or perceived failure of our products to detect or prevent malware, viruses, worms or similar threats is a flaw or indicates that our products do not provide significant value, our reputation and business could be harmed.</div><div></div><div>Any real or perceived defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, or any failure of our products to detect a threat, could result in:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>a loss of existing or potential end-customers or channel partners;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>delayed or lost revenue;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the expenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects, to address and eliminate vulnerabilities, to remediate harms potentially caused by those vulnerabilities, or to identify and ramp up production with third-party providers;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>an increase in warranty claims, or an increase in the cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margins;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>harm to our reputation or brand; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and further harm our reputation.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects.</div><div></div><div>Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end-customers for losses that they sustain. If end-customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Historically, the amount of warranty claims has not been significant, but there are no assurances that the amount of such claims will not be material in the future. Liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale, and those of our resellers and distributors, may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from customer claims and related liabilities and costs, including indemnification obligations under our agreements with resellers, distributors or end-customers. The sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert managements time and other resources.</div><div></div><div>Failure to protect and ensure the confidentiality and security of data could lead to legal liability, adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, business and reputation.</div><div></div><div>We may collect, store and use certain confidential information in the course of providing our services, and we have invested in preserving the security of this data. We may also outsource operations to third-party service providers to whom we transmit certain confidential data. There are no assurances that any security measures we have in place, or any additional security measures that our subcontractors may have in place, will be sufficient to protect this confidential information from unauthorized security breaches.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>25</div></div><div></div><div>We cannot assure you that, despite the implementation of these security measures, we will not be subject to a security incident or other data breach or that this data will not be compromised. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches, or to pay penalties as a result of such breaches. Despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures to protect this data. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or service providers or by other persons or entities with whom we have commercial relationships. Any compromise or perceived compromise of our security could damage our reputation with our end-customers, and could subject us to significant liability, as well as regulatory action, including financial penalties, which would materially adversely affect our brand, results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.</div><div></div><div>We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs to protect against security breaches. We may incur significant additional costs in the future to address problems caused by any actual or perceived security breaches.</div><div></div><div>Breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, or other security incidents, could result in: unauthorized access to our sites, networks and systems; unauthorized access to, misuse or misappropriation of information, including personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our sites, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our sites; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to notification of individuals, or other forms of breach remediation; deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies; response to governmental investigations and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third-party experts and consultants; litigation, regulatory investigations, prosecutions, and other actions; and other potential liabilities. If any of these events occurs, or is believed to occur, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, and our ability to operate our business, including our ability to provide maintenance and support services to our channel partners and end-customers, may be impaired. If current or prospective channel partners and end-customers believe that our systems and solutions do not provide adequate security for their businesses needs, our business and our financial results could be harmed. Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.</div><div></div><div>Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any actual or perceived compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, or any unauthorized access to, misuse or misappropriation of personally identifiable information, channel partners or end-customers information, or other information, could violate applicable laws and regulations, contractual obligations or other legal obligations and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, any of which could have an material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.</div><div></div><div>Our failure to adequately protect personal data could have a material adverse effect on our business.</div><div></div><div>A wide variety of provincial, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and being tested in courts and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, the European Union has adopted a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, to supersede the Data Protection Directive. This regulation, which took full effect on May25, 2018, has caused EU data protection requirements to be more stringent and provide for greater penalties. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to 20 million or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including significant fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected persons and entities, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing and prospective channel partners and end-customers), and other forms of injunctive or operations-limiting relief, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Evolving and changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, machine identification, location data, biometric data and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. We may be required to expend significant resources to modify our solutions and otherwise adapt to these changes, which we may be </div><div></div><div><div>26</div></div><div></div><div>unable to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our ability to develop new solutions and features could be limited. These developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and inhibit adoption of our products by current and prospective end-customers.</div><div></div><div>If the general level of advanced cyberattacks declines, or is perceived by our current or potential customers to have declined, our business could be harmed.</div><div></div><div>Our security business may be dependent on enterprises and governments recognizing that advanced cyberattacks are pervasive and are not effectively prevented by legacy security solutions. High visibility attacks on prominent companies and governments have increased market awareness of advanced cyberattacks and help to provide an impetus for enterprises and governments to devote resources to protecting against advanced cyberattacks, which may include testing, purchasing and deploying our products. If advanced cyberattacks were to decline, or enterprises or governments perceived a decline in the general level of advanced cyberattacks, our ability to attract new channel partners and end-customers and expand our offerings within existing channel partners and end-customers could be materially and adversely affected. An actual or perceived reduction in the threat landscape could increase our sales cycles and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Undetected software or hardware errors may harm our business and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>Our products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades. We expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial distribution. These problems have in the past and may in the future cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors or defects. While we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability, these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. A material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>Any errors, defects or vulnerabilities in our products could result in:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>expenditures of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors and defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>loss of existing or potential end-customers or distribution channel partners;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>delayed or lost revenue;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>delay or failure to attain market acceptance;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>indemnification obligations under our agreements with resellers, distributors and/or end-customers;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our gross margin; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Our use of open source software in our products could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.</div><div></div><div>We incorporate open source software such as the Linux operating system kernel into our products. We have  implemented a formal open source use policy, including written guidelines for use of open source software and business processes for approval of that use. We have developed and implemented our open source policies according to industry practice; however, best practices in this area are subject to change, because there is little reported case law on the interpretation of material terms of many open source licenses. We are in the process of reviewing our open source use and our compliance with open source licenses and implementing remediation and changes necessary to comply with the open source licenses related thereto. We cannot guarantee that our use of open source software has been, and will be, managed effectively for our intended business purposes and/or compliant with applicable open source licenses. We may face legal action by third parties seeking to enforce their intellectual property rights related to our use of such open source software. Failure to adequately manage open </div><div></div><div><div>27</div></div><div></div><div>source license compliance and our use of open source software may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products and services, such as a requirement that we license proprietary portions of our products or services on unfavorable terms, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we created based upon, incorporating or using open source software, that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license and/or that we redesign the affected products or services, which could result, for example, in a loss of intellectual property rights, or delay in providing our products and services. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use third-party open source software in their products and services, asserting that the open source software or its combination with the products or services infringes third parties patents or copyrights, or that the companies distribution or use of the open source software does not comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses. Use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of warranted third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of such open source software. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that use open source software in their products, challenging the ownership of rights in such open source software. As a result, we could also be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of rights in what we believe to be open source software and so challenging our right to use such software in our products. If any such claims were asserted against us, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such a claim. Further, if our defenses to such a claim were not successful, we could be, for example, subject to significant damages, be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products and services without infringing such third partys intellectual property rights, be required to re-engineer such products and services, or be required to discontinue making available such products and services if re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis. The need to engage in these or other remedies could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Our products must interoperate with operating systems, software applications and hardware that are developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may fail to increase, or we may lose market share and we may experience a weakening demand for our products.</div><div></div><div>Our products must interoperate with our end-customers existing infrastructure, specifically their networks, servers, software and operating systems, which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. The occurrence of software or hardware problems, whether caused by our products or another vendors products, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products. In addition, when new or updated versions of our end-customers software operating systems or applications are introduced, we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly, cost-effectively or at all. These development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources. If we fail to maintain compatibility with these applications, our end-customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products, and we may, among other consequences, fail to increase, or we may lose market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.</div><div></div><div>Many of our products include proprietary technologies licensed from third parties. In the future, it may be necessary to renew licenses for third party technology or obtain new licenses for other technology. These third-party licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. As a result, we could also face delays or be unable to make changes to our products until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed and integrated with our products. Such delays or an inability to make changes to our products, if it were to occur, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The inability to obtain certain licenses to third-party technology, or litigation regarding the interpretation or enforcement of license agreements and related intellectual property issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Failure to prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages could result in decreased revenue and gross margin and harm our business.</div><div></div><div>We purchase products from our manufacturers outside of, and in advance of, reseller or end-customer orders, which we hold in inventory and sell. We place orders with our manufacturers based on our forecasts of our end-customers requirements and forecasts provided by our distribution channel partners. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which might cause our estimates to be inaccurate, affecting our ability to provide products to our customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from our manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in obsolete inventory and inventory write-downs. The sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our </div><div></div><div><div>28</div></div><div></div><div>products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to resellers, distributors and customers and cause us to lose sales. These shortages may diminish the loyalty of our distribution channel partners or customers.</div><div></div><div>The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future financial condition and results of operations from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our total revenue and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. </div><div></div><div>Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, primarily due to the complexity of our end-customers networks and data centers and the length of their budget cycles. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.</div><div></div><div>The timing of our sales is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products sales cycles. A sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end-customer and any sale of our products. Our sales cycle, in particular to our large end-customers, may be lengthy due to the complexity of their networks and data centers. Because of this complexity, prospective end-customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase our products. End-customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision that can have important implications on their existing networks and data centers and, as a result, require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order to ensure that our products will successfully interoperate with our end-customers complex network and data centers. Additionally, the budgetary decisions at these entities can be lengthy and require multiple organization reviews. The length of time that end-customers devote to their evaluation of our products and decision making process varies significantly. The length of our products sales cycles typically ranges from three to 12months but can be longer for our large end-customers. In addition, the length of our close or sales cycle can be affected by the extent to which customized features are requested, in particular in our large deals.</div><div></div><div>For all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed or the particular fiscal period in which a sale will be completed, both of which contribute to the uncertainty of our future operating results. If our close or sales cycles lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.</div><div></div><div>Our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining end-customers of all sizes and is critical to the deployment of our products. When support is purchased our end-customers depend on our support organization to provide a broad range of support services, including on-site technical support, 24-hour support and shipment of replacement parts on an expedited basis. If our support organization or our distribution channel partners do not assist our end-customers in deploying our products effectively, succeed in helping our end-customers resolve post-deployment issues quickly, or provide ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end-customers and could harm our reputation with potential end-customers. We currently have technical support centers in the United States, Japan, China, India and the Netherlands. As we continue to expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English.</div><div></div><div>We typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase, and a substantial portion of our support revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts. Our end-customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period. If we are unable to provide high quality support, our end-customers may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts, thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts.</div><div></div><div>Our failure or the failure of our distribution channel partners to maintain high-quality support and services could have a material and adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.</div><div></div><div>We depend on growth in markets relating to network security, management and analysis, and lack of growth or contraction in one or more of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Demand for our products is linked to, among other things, growth in the size and complexity of network infrastructures and the demand for networking technologies addressing the security, management and analysis of such infrastructures. These markets are dynamic and evolving. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on </div><div></div><div><div>29</div></div><div></div><div>continued growth in the number of organizations investing in their network infrastructure and the amount they commit to such investments. If this demand declines, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Segments of the network infrastructure industry have in the past experienced significant economic downturns. Furthermore, the market for network infrastructure may not continue to grow at historic rates, or at all. The occurrence of any of these factors in the markets relating to network security, management and analysis could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. </div><div></div><div>You should not consider our revenue growth rate in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. We have recently experienced revenue growth rates of 4%, 16%and 9%in 2017, 2016and 2015as compared to the same prior periods. We may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability.</div><div></div><div>Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth in certain prior periods and may experience rapid growth at certain times in the future, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our controls, systems and processes, our operating results will be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>In certain recent periods, we have significantly increased the number of our employees and independent contractors. As we hire new employees and independent contractors and expand into new locations outside the United States, we are required to comply with varying local laws for each of these new locations. We anticipate that further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount will be required. Our growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and financial resources. Our ability to manage our operations and growth across multiple countries will require us to continue to refine our operational, financial and management controls, human resource policies, and reporting systems and processes.</div><div></div><div>We need to continue to improve our internal systems, processes, and controls to effectively manage our operations and growth. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems, processes and controls in an efficient or timely manner. In addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. For example, as described inItem 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we recently identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could impair our ability to provide products or services to our customers in a timely manner, causing us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, increase our technical support costs, or damage our reputation and brand. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings, or to prevent certain losses, any of which may harm our business and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>We may not be able to sustain or develop new distributor and reseller relationships, and a reduction or delay in sales to significant distribution channel partners could hurt our business.</div><div></div><div>We sell our products and services through multiple distribution channels in the United States and internationally. We may not be able to increase our number of distributor or reseller relationships or maintain our existing relationships. Recruiting and retaining qualified distribution channel partners and training them on our technologies requires significant time and resources. These distribution channel partners may also market, sell and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such competitive products. Our sales channel structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our distribution channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies. If we are unable to establish or maintain our sales channels or if our distribution channel partners are unable to adapt to our future sales focus and needs, our business and results of operations will be harmed.</div><div></div><div>The terms of the 2016 Credit Facility could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions.</div><div></div><div>In November 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the 2016 Credit Facility) with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), as the lender. The 2016 Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. The 2016 Credit </div><div></div><div><div>30</div></div><div></div><div>Facility requires us to satisfy specified covenants. As of the date of this filing, we had no outstanding balance under the 2016 Credit Facility and were in compliance with all covenants except for the annual audited financial statement with an unqualified opinion no later than 180 days after the last day of the fiscal year.However, SVB has granted a forbearance on this requirement through August 31, 2018. If we continue to remain in noncompliance, or fail to comply with these covenants in the future, SVB could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If SVB accelerates the repayment, if any, we may not have sufficient funds to repay our existing debt. If we were unable to repay those amounts, SVB could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property, as collateral under the 2016 Credit Facility. </div><div></div><div>Our sales to governmental organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks.</div><div></div><div>We sell to governmental organization end-customers. Sales to governmental organizations are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to governmental organizations can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. We have not yet received security clearance from the United States government, which prevents us from being able to sell directly for certain governmental uses. There can be no assurance that such clearance will be obtained, and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results. Governmental organization demand and payment for our products may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products. Governmental organizations may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results.</div><div></div><div>Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.</div><div></div><div>Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.</div><div></div><div>Our products are subject to U.S. export controls and may be exported outside the United States only with the required level of export license or through an export license exception because we incorporate encryption technology into our products. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or our end-customers ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our end-customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end-customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We discovered that trial software was inadvertently available for download by any international user and, on limited occasions, was downloaded by individuals located in a U.S. sanctioned country. We implemented corrective actions and filed a Voluntary Self Disclosure in February 2017 with the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of Treasury regarding these technical violations. Both agencies closed their review without any fines or penalties.</div><div></div><div>We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>31</div></div><div></div><div>Our company must comply with local, state, federal, and international environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We are also subject to laws, which restrict certain hazardous substances, including lead, used in the construction of our products, such as the European Union Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive. We are also subject to the European Union Directive, known as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), which requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to properly label products, register as a WEEE producer, and provide for the collection, disposal and recycling of waste electronic products. Failure to comply with these environmental directives and other environmental laws could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, inability to sell covered products in certain countries, the loss of revenue, or subject us to third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or require us to incur investigation, remediation or engineering costs. Our operations and products will be affected by future environmental laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such future laws and regulations at this time.</div><div></div><div>Our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end-customers in our markets.</div><div></div><div>Generally, our products comprise only a part of a data center. The servers, network, software and other components and systems of a data center must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate and function efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards. Often, these companies are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end-customers. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and we may need to incur substantial costs to conform our products to such standards, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We are dependent on various information technology systems, and failures of or interruptions to those systems could harm our business.</div><div></div><div>Many of our business processes depend upon our information technology systems, the systems and processes of third parties, and on interfaces with the systems of third parties. If those systems fail or are interrupted, or if our ability to connect to or interact with one or more networks is interrupted, our processes may function at a diminished level or not at all. This could harm our ability to ship or support our products, and our financial results may be harmed.</div><div></div><div>In addition, reconfiguring or upgrading our information technology systems or other business processes in response to changing business needs may be time-consuming and costly and is subject to risks of delay or failed deployment. To the extent this impacts our ability to react timely to specific market or business opportunities, our financial results may be harmed.</div><div></div><div>Future acquisitions we may undertake may not result in the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction.</div><div></div><div>We completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Appcito in June 2016 and may make future acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies. With respect to the Appcito acquisition or any other future acquisitions we may undertake, we may find that the acquired businesses, products or technologies do not further our business strategy as expected, that we paid more than what the assets are later worth or that economic conditions change, all of which may generate future impairment charges. The Appcito acquisition or any future acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. There may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of an acquired business, and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of an acquired business. We may have difficulty in integrating acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Our ongoing business and managements attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations. We may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across locations. We may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality, technology and other matters.</div><div></div><div>Our inability to successfully operate and integrate future acquisitions appropriately, effectively and in a timely manner, or to retain key personnel of any acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and expenses.</div><div></div><div>Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation and may result in increased future tax liability to us.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>32</div></div><div></div><div>Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporations stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change. In the event we have undergone an ownership change under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.</div><div></div><div>Changes in tax laws or regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>expected timing and amount of the release of tax valuation allowances;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>expiration of, or detrimental changes in, research and development tax credit laws;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>tax effects of stock-based compensation;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>costs related to intercompany restructurings;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>future earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates; or</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>examinations by US federal, state or foreign jurisdictions that disagree with interpretations of tax rules and regulations in regards to positions taken on tax filings, including the current examination by the Internal Revenue Service of our 2015 and 2014 tax returns.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>As our business grows, we are required to comply with increasingly complex taxation rules and practices. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and in foreign tax jurisdictions as we expand internationally. The development of our tax strategies requires additional expertise and may impact how we conduct our business. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Furthermore, we provide for certain tax liabilities that involve significant judgment. We are subject to the examination of our tax returns by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which could focus on our intercompany transfer pricing methodology as well as other matters. If our tax strategies are ineffective or we are not in compliance with domestic and international tax laws, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>In addition, from time to time the United States, foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies. For example, the Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income , or GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder. We are still evaluating the tax provisions related to GILTI and we have not made a policy election on how to account for the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act as allowed by the U.S. generally accepted accounting standards. Our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what is the anticipated impact.</div><div></div><div>We are exposed to the credit risk of our distribution channel partners and end-customers, which could result in material losses and negatively impact our operating results.</div><div></div><div>Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms ranging from 30to 90days depending on local customs or conditions that exist in the sale location. If any of the distribution channel partners or end-customersresponsible for a significant portion of our revenue becomes insolvent or suffers a deterioration in its financial or business condition and is unable to pay for our products, our results of operations could be harmed.</div><div></div><div><div>33</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.</div><div></div><div>Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued accounting standards update No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We will adopt Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. This or other changes in accounting principles could adversely affect our financial results. See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. Any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors confidence in us.</div><div></div><div>Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, a small number of stockholders, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.</div><div></div><div>Our executive officers and directors, together with affiliated entities, own 39.0%of our outstanding common stock as of December31, 2017. Accordingly, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over the election of our directors, over whether matters requiring stockholder approval are approved or disapproved and over our affairs in general. The interests of these stockholders could conflict with your interests. These stockholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. In addition, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a liquidity event such as a merger or liquidation of our company.</div><div></div><div>Certain stockholders could attempt to influence changes at the Company, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. </div><div></div><div>Our stockholders may from time-to-time seek to acquire a controlling stake in us, engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly-traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, and could disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. These actions could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.</div><div></div><div>We may need to raise additional funds in future private or public offerings, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do raise additional funds, existing stockholders will suffer dilution.</div><div></div><div>We may need to raise additional funds in private or public offerings, and these funds may not be available to us when we need them or on acceptable terms, if at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, you could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our then-existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business and prospects could fail or be materially and adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.</div><div></div><div>Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in response to many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div><div>34</div></div><div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in our industry;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>whether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>litigation or investigations involving us, our industry, or both;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>regulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>general economic conditions and trends;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>major catastrophic events;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>sales of large blocks of our common stock; or</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>departures of key personnel.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. The price of our common stock has been highly volatile since our initial public offering (IPO) in March 2014. In January 2015, several substantially identical putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of securities laws were filed against us, our directors and certain of our executive officers and in June 2015, a related shareholder derivative action was filed. The consolidated securities class actions and the derivative action were settled in 2016 and dismissed in the first quarter of 2017. In March 2018, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of securities laws was filed against us and certain of our current and former executive officers, and in May 2018, a related shareholder derivative action was filed. In March 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission began a private investigation into any securities laws violations by us or persons currently or formerly affiliated with us. Current or future securities litigation, including any related shareholder derivative litigation or investigation, could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</div><div></div><div>Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.</div><div></div><div>Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. As of December31, 2017, there were approximately 5.0 millionvested and exercisable options to purchase our common stock, in addition to the 71.7 millioncommon shares outstanding as of such date. All outstanding shares and all shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding and vested options are freely tradable, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, as well as our insider trading policy. In addition, holders of certain shares of our outstanding common stock, including an aggregate of 9.5 millionshares held by funds affiliated with Summit Partners, L.P. as of December31, 2017are entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to an investors rights agreement.</div><div></div><div>If these holders of our common stock, by exercising their registration rights, sell a large number of shares, they could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. If we file a registration statement for the purposes of selling additional shares to raise capital and are required to include shares held by these holders pursuant to the exercise of their registration </div><div></div><div><div>35</div></div><div></div><div>rights, our ability to raise capital may be impaired. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.</div><div></div><div>We are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.</div><div></div><div>We are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (a)the last day of the year (i)following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the initial public offering, (ii)in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (iii)in which we qualify as a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, or (b)the date on which we have issued more than $1.07 billion innon-convertibledebt securities during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.</div><div></div><div>Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.</div><div></div><div>We are obligated to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2017, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. In the future, we may again not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or our internal control over financial reporting may not be determined to be effective, or we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, all of which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.</div><div></div><div>We are required, pursuant to the Exchange Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each fiscal year. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.</div><div></div><div>We have, in the past, experienced and are currently experiencing issues with our internal control over financial reporting. We have discovered and it is possible that we may discover in the future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Current significant deficiencies and material weaknesses have resulted in a restatement of certain of our financial reports, as described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If, in any future reporting periods, we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we are required to restate our financial statements as a result of ineffective internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.</div><div></div><div>We are required to disclose material changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the year following the date we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. To comply with these requirements, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff.</div><div></div><div>If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.</div><div></div><div>The market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who </div><div></div><div><div>36</div></div><div></div><div>cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which would cause our share price or trading volume to decline.</div><div></div><div>Our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.</div><div></div><div>Our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; provided, that at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders will be voting on a proposal to declassify our board of directors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preference and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our secretary, or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66-2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or not to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirors own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.</div><div></div><div>Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as acts of war and terrorism.</div><div></div><div>A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, a flood, or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, our two primary manufacturers are located in Taiwan, which is near major earthquake fault lines and subject to typhoons during certain times of the year. In the event of a major earthquake or typhoon, or other natural or man-made disaster, our manufacturers in Taiwan may face business interruptions, which may impact quality assurance, product costs, and product supply and timing. In the event our or our service providers </div><div></div><div><div>37</div></div><div></div><div>information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, and our operations could be disrupted, for the affected quarter or quarters. In addition, cyber security attacks, acts of war or terrorism, or other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners, or end-customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or end-customers that impacts sales at the end of a quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.</div><div></div><div>We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. In addition, the 2016 Credit Facility currently restricts our ability to pay cash dividends while this facility remains outstanding. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the value of our common stock increases.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\u00b0Item"

Our portfolio of software and hardware solutions combines industry-leading performance and scale with advanced intelligent automation, machine learning, data driven analytics, and threat intelligence to ensure security and availability of customer applications across their multi-cloud networks, including on-premise, private and public clouds.</div><div></div><div>Our product portfolio seeks to address many of the aforementioned challenges and solution requirements. The portfolio consists of sixsecure application solutions; Thunder ADC, Lightning ADC, Thunder CGN, Thunder TPS, Thunder SSLi and Thunder CFW and intelligent management, and automation tools; Harmony Controller and aGalaxy. Our products are offered in a variety of form factors and payment models, including physical appliances and software licenses, as well as pay-as-you-go licensing models and FlexPool, a flexible consumption-based software model. </div><div></div><div>We derive revenue from sales of products and related support services. Products revenue is generated primarily by sales of hardware appliances with perpetual licenses to our embedded software solutions. We also derive revenue from licenses to, or subscription services for, software-only versions of our solutions. We generate services revenue primarily from sales of maintenance and support contracts. Our customers predominantly purchase maintenance and support in conjunction with purchases of our products. In addition, we also derive revenue from the sale of professional services.</div><div></div><div>We sell our products globally to service providers and enterprises that depend on data center applications and networks to generate revenue and manage operations efficiently. Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including telecommunications, technology, industrial, retail, financial, gaming, education and government. Since inception, our customer base has grown rapidly. As of December31, 2017, we had sold products to approximately 6,200customers across 83countries.</div><div></div><div>We sell substantially all of our solutions through our high-touch sales organization as well as distribution channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers and system integrators, and fulfill nearly all orders globally through such partners. We believe this sales approach allows us to obtain the benefits of channel distribution, such as expanding our market coverage, while still maintaining face-to-face relationships with our end-customers. We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products to original design manufacturers. We perform quality assurance and testing at our San Jose, Taiwan and Japan distribution centers, as well as at our manufacturers locations.</div><div></div><div>During the year ended December31, 2017, 49%of our total revenue was generated from the United States, 22%from Japan and 29%from other geographical regions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 51%of our total revenue was generated from the United States,23%from Japan and 26%from other geographical regions. During 2015, 54%of our total revenue was generated from the United States, 18%from Japan and 28%from other geographical regions.</div><div></div><div>As a result of the nature of our target market and the current stage of our development, a substantial portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of large customers, including service providers, in any period.During the years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015, purchases from our ten largest end-customers accounted for 35%, 36%and 32%of our total revenue, respectively. Sales to these large end-customers have typically been characterized by large but irregular purchases with long sales cycles. The timing of these purchases and the delivery of the purchased products are difficult to </div><div></div><div><div>42</div></div><div></div><div>predict. As a consequence, any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases by or deliveries to our largest customers could materially impact our revenue and operating results in any quarterly period. This may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and make them difficult to predict.</div><div>We had $46.6 millionof cash and cash equivalents and$84.6 millionof marketable securities as of December31, 2017. Cash generated by operating activities was $14.3 millionin 2017as compared to $18.8 millionin 2016.</div><div></div><div>We intend tocontinue to invest for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in our product development efforts to deliver new products and additional features in our current products to address customer needs. In addition, we may expand our global sales and marketing organizations, expand our distribution channel partner programs and increase awareness of our solutions on a global basis. Additionally, we will be investing in general and administrative resources to meet the requirements to operate as a public company.Our investments in growth in these areas may affect our short-term

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.

The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35percent to 21percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.</div><div></div><div>As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, we revalued our U.S. net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017. The revaluation is based on the rates at which the U.S. net deferred tax assets are expected to reverse in the future. There was no impact to the balance sheet and income statement due to the full valuation allowance placed on the deferred tax assets for the U.S.We will continue to review and assess the potential future impact of the legislation and how it may apply to future periods. Please see Note 9. Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for further details.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Liquidity and Capital Resources</div><div></div><div>As of December31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.6 million, including approximately $4.8 millionheld outside the United States in our foreign subsidiaries, and$84.6 millionof marketable securities.We currently do not have any plans to repatriate our earnings from our foreign operations. As of December31, 2017, we had working capital of $111.1 million, an accumulated deficit of $257.0 millionand total stockholders equity of $98.4 million.</div><div></div><div>We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth, and our investment may increase. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other available financial resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.</div><div></div><div>On October 27, 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $20.0 million of our common stock over 12 months.Under the repurchase authorization, shares may be purchased from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means.

We used approximately $3.1 millionand $1.8 millionof cash for share repurchases during the years ended December31, 2017and 2016, respectively.</div><div></div><div>On October 23, 2017, our board of directors authorized another share repurchase program for up to$20.0 millionof our common stock over12months.Under the repurchase authorization, shares may be purchased from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means. The repurchase authorization may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. No shares were repurchased under this repurchase program as of December31, 2017.</div><div></div><div>In addition, as described in Note 6. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, we are currently, or may be from time to time be, involved in ongoing litigation.

The 2016 Credit Facility provides athree-year,$25.0 millionrevolving credit facility, which includes a maximum of$25.0 million letter of credit subfacility. When the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equals or exceeds $50.0 million, loans may be advanced under the 2016 Credit Facility up to the full $25.0 million. When the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit falls below $50.0 million, loans may be advanced under the 2016 Credit Facility based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. The loans bear interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus 0.50% or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus 2.50%.</div><div></div><div>Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property. The 2016 Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, in each case subject to customary exceptions, and customary events of default. In addition, the 2016 Credit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 1:50:1.00, as determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility.

Our actual results could differ from these estimates.        </div><div>We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</div><div></div><div>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</div><div></div><div>We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on known collection risks and historical experience. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we record reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our historical experience of collections and write-offs. </div><div></div><div>Inventory</div><div></div><div>Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and related component parts and is stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value (estimated net realizable value). We evaluate inventory for excess and obsolete products, based on managements assessment of future demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs, once established, are not reversed as they establish a new cost basis for the inventory. Inventory write downs are included as a component of cost of products revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.</div><div></div><div>Revenue Recognition  </div><div></div><div>We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and product-based subscription; and (ii) services revenue, which include post contract support (PCS), professional services, and training. A substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of our products and services through distribution channel partners, such as resellers and distributors. Revenue is recognized, net of applicable taxes, when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. </div><div></div><div>We define each of the four criteria above as follows:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We do not have significant obligations for future performance, such as customer acceptance provisions, rights of return, or pricing credits, associated with our sales.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div></div><div><div>54</div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Standard payment terms to customers range from 30 to 90 days.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Collection is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collection on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. For sales made through distribution channel partners, collectability is assessed independent of the end customers ability to pay.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>PCS revenue includes arrangements for software support and technical support for our products. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches, and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. Revenue for PCS services is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term, which is typically one year, but can be up to five years. Unearned PCS revenue is included in deferred revenue.</div><div></div><div>Professional service revenue primarilyconsists of the fees we earn related to installation and consulting services. We recognize revenue from professional services upon delivery or completion of performance. Professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within 30 to 90 days from the start of service.</div><div></div><div>Multiple-Element Arrangements</div><div></div><div>Our hardware with the embedded software solutions (which is a proprietary operating system that together with the hardware delivers the functionality desired by our customers), is considered a separate unit of accounting from PCS because it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and our sales arrangements do not include a right of return for delivered products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the inception of the arrangement. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or service.</div><div></div><div>When applying the relative selling price method, we determine the selling price for each element using (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.</div><div></div><div> VSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.</div><div></div><div> TPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not typically able to determine TPE.</div><div></div><div> BESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.</div><div></div><div>The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a standalone basis. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and some of our services, we determine BESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement, primarily based on historical transaction pricing. Historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), offering type (product series, and level of support for PCS) and type of sales channel. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management.</div><div></div><div>We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues or solution-fit issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied </div><div></div><div><div>55</div></div><div></div><div>against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. Management also analyzes changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances.</div><div></div><div>Stock-Based Compensation</div><div></div><div>Stock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair valueof restricted stock units (RSUs) is estimated using our stock price on the grant date. The fair valueof options and employee stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes model on the grant date. The Black-Scholes model determines the fair value of share-based payment awards based on assumptions including expected term, stock price volatility, and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of market-performance based restricted stock units (MSUs) is valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses the stock price, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate to determine the fair value.</div><div></div><div>Income Taxes </div><div></div><div>We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or in our tax returns. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through an adjustment to income tax expense.</div><div></div><div>The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Assumptions represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment.</div><div></div><div>We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our consolidated financial statements by regularly reviewing our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</div><div></div><div>Information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements may be found in Note 1.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</div><div></div><div>Foreign Currency Risk</div><div></div><div>Our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the most significant exception being Japan where we invoice primarily in Japanese yen. Our costs and expenses are generally denominated in the currencies where our operations are located, which is primarily in North America, Japan and, to a lesser extent, EMEA and the Asia Pacific region. In2016, we initiated a hedging program with respect to foreign currency risk. Revenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs and expenses incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our revenue and operating income. As exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations.</div><div></div><div>The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to remeasurement are recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. A significant fluctuation in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries local currencies, especially the Japanese yen, British Pound and Euro, and the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.</div><div></div><div>We recorded $0.4 million, $1.6 millionand $0.5 millionforeign exchange loss during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, respectively.

Our marketable securities are comprised of certificates of deposit, corporate securities, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, commercial paper and asset-backed securities. At December31, 2017, our investment portfolio included marketable securities with an aggregate fair market value of $84.6 millionand a cost basis of $84.7 million. </div><div></div><div>The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our marketable securities assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS as of December31, 2017(in thousands):</div><div><div><table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>Fair Value as of</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>(150 BPS)</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>(100 BPS)</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>(50 BPS)</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>12/31/2017</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>50 BPS</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>100 BPS</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>150 BPS</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Marketable securities</div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>85,258</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>85,030</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>84,798</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>84,567</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>84,335</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>84,103</div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div></div></td><td><div>$</div></td><td><div>83,872</div></td><td><div></div></td></tr></table></div></div><div></div><div></div><div><div>61</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\u00b0Item"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</div><div>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</div><div>Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>/s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP </div><div>San Jose, California </div><div>August28,

Statements</div><div></div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</div><div></div><div>Description of Business</div><div></div><div>A10 Networks, Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, the Company, we, our or us) was incorporated in California in2004and reincorporated inDelawarein March 2014. We are headquartered in San Jose, California and have wholly-owned subsidiaries throughout the world including Asia and Europe. </div><div></div><div>We are a leading provider of secure application solutions and services that enable a new generation of intelligently</div><div>connected companies with the ability to continuously improve cyber protection and digital responsiveness across dynamic</div><div>Information Technology (IT) and network infrastructures. Our product portfolio seeks to address many of the aforementioned challenges and solution requirements. The portfolio consists of sixsecure application solutions; Thunder Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Lightning Application Delivery Controller (Lightning ADC), Thunder Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGN), Thunder Threat Protection System (TPS), Thunder SSL Insight (SSLi) and Thunder Convergent Firewall (CFW), and twointelligent management and automation tools; Harmony Controller and aGalaxy. Our solutions are available in a variety of form factors, such as optimized hardware appliances, bare metal software, virtual appliances and cloud-native software.</div><div></div><div>Basis of Presentation</div><div></div><div>The accompanying consolidated financial statementsinclude those of A10 Networks, Inc. and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).</div><div></div><div>Reclassifications</div><div></div><div>Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows. We have presented goodwill as a separate line item from intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and goodwill and intangible assets as separate line items from other non-current assets as of December 31, 2015. We have separately presented the line items Proceeds from sales of marketable securities and Maturities of marketable securities as opposed to our historical consolidated presentation of Proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.</div><div></div><div>Use of Estimates</div><div></div><div>The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Those estimates and assumptions affect revenue recognition and deferred revenue, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the sales return reserve, the valuation of inventory, the fair value of marketable securities, contingencies and litigation, acquisition related purchase price allocations, accrued liabilities, and the determination of fair value of stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from managements estimates.</div><div></div><div>Significant Accounting Policies</div><div></div><div>Cash and Cash Equivalents</div><div></div><div>We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents consist of money market funds. </div><div></div><div>Marketable securities</div><div></div><div>We classify our investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale and record these investments at fair value. These investments are classified as current assets and included in marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reflected in our consolidated </div><div></div><div><div>70</div></div><div></div><div>statements of operations. Realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairment charges, if any, on marketable securities are reported in interest and other income (expense), net as incurred. </div><div></div><div>We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Investments are considered impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. If the cost of an individual investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, we will record an impairment charge and establish a new cost basis in the investment. </div><div></div><div>Fair Value Measurement</div><div></div><div>Our financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment. Our cash equivalents, which include money market funds, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Marketable securities are comprised of certificates of deposit, corporate securities, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, commercial paper and asset-backed securities and are measured at fair value using the three-level valuation hierarchyas described below.</div><div></div><div>Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.</div><div></div><div>Level 2 - Inputs are observable,quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.</div><div></div><div>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.</div><div></div><div>Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</div><div></div><div>Accounts receivable are recorded at invoice amounts, net of allowances for doubtful accounts. We evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on known collection risks and historical experience. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we record reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our historical experience of collections and write-offs. </div><div></div><div>Inventory</div><div></div><div>Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and related component parts and is stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market value (estimated net realizable value). We evaluate inventory for excess and obsolete products, based on managements assessment of future demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs, once established, are not reversed as they establish a new cost basis for the inventory. Inventory write downs are included as a component of cost of products revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. </div><div></div><div>Property and Equipment, Net</div><div></div><div>Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Depreciation on property and equipment, excluding leasehold improvements, ranges from 1to 3years.</div><div></div><div>Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term. Amortization on leasehold improvements ranges from 2to 8years.</div><div></div><div>Goodwill</div><div></div><div>Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for possible impairment annually in the fourth quarter or </div><div></div><div><div>71</div></div><div></div><div>more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment tests, and the fair value of our reporting unit has been determined by our enterprise value. </div><div>When assessing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not (i.e.greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. </div><div>Examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting units fair value is less than the carrying amount include macro-economic conditions such as (i) a significant adverse change in customer demand or a severe deterioration in the entitys operating environment and market conditions; (ii) entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or (iii) other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or there will be a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.</div><div></div><div>If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit, and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill during the fiscal years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015.</div><div></div><div>Intangible Assets</div><div></div><div>Intangible assets consist of developed technology and patents resulting from acquisitions. Intangible assets are recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5to 10years. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the fiscal years ended December31, 2017, 2016and 2015.</div><div></div><div>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</div><div></div><div>We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived asset may not be recoverable.Recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset group is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value.</div><div></div><div>Revenue Recognition  </div><div></div><div>We derive revenue from two sources: (i) products revenue, which includes hardware, perpetual software license and product-based subscription; and (ii) services revenue, which includes post contract support (PCS), professional services, and training. A substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of our products and services through distribution channel partners, such as resellers and distributors. Revenue is recognized, net of applicable taxes, when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. </div><div></div><div>We define each of the four criteria above as follows:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We do not have significant obligations for future performance, such as customer rights of return or pricing credits associated with our sales.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div></div><div><div>72</div></div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Standard payment terms to customers range from 30 to 90 days.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Collection is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collection on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. For sales made through distribution channel partners, collectability is assessed independent of the end customers ability to pay.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>PCS revenue includes arrangements for software support and technical support for our products. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches, and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. Revenue for PCS services is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term, which is typically one year, but can be up to five years. Unearned PCS revenue is included in deferred revenue.</div><div></div><div>Professional service revenue primarilyconsists of the fees we earn related to installation and consulting services. We recognize revenue from professional services upon delivery or completion of performance. Professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within 30 to 90 days from the start of service.</div><div></div><div>Multiple-Element Arrangements</div><div></div><div>Our hardware with the embedded software solutions (which is a proprietary operating system that together with the hardware delivers the functionality desired by our customers), is considered a separate unit of accounting from PCS because it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and our sales arrangements do not include a right of return for delivered products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the inception of the arrangement. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative selling price method. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or service.</div><div></div><div>When applying the relative selling price method, we determine the selling price for each element using (i) vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available; (ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price, if VSOE is not available; and (iii) best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.</div><div></div><div> VSOE. We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.</div><div></div><div> TPE. When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not typically able to determine TPE.</div><div></div><div> BESP. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.</div><div></div><div>The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a standalone basis. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and some of our services, we determine BESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement, primarily based on historical transaction pricing. Historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), offering type (product series, and level of support for PCS) and type of sales channel. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management.</div><div></div><div>We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues or solution-fit issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied </div><div></div><div><div>73</div></div><div></div><div>against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered within this estimate. Management also analyzes changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of returns and sales allowances.</div><div></div><div>Deferred Revenue</div><div></div><div>Deferred product revenue relates to arrangements where not all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Deferred services revenue primarily represents PCS contracts billed in advance and revenue is recognized ratably over the service contract term, typically 1to 5years. </div><div></div><div>Shipping and Handling</div><div></div><div>Shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenue in the period shipped and the related costs are included in cost of revenue.</div><div></div><div>Research and Development Costs</div><div></div><div>Research and development efforts are focused on new product development and on developing additional functionality for our existing products. These expenses consist of personnel costs, and to a lesser extent, prototype materials, depreciation and certain allocated facilities and information technology costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred. </div><div></div><div>Stock-Based Compensation</div><div></div><div>Stock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair valueof restricted stock units (RSUs) is estimated using our stock price on the grant date. The fair valueof options and employee stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes model on the grant date. The Black-Scholes model determines the fair value of share-based payment awards based on assumptions including expected term, stock price volatility, and risk-free interest rate. The fair value of market-performance based restricted stock units (MSUs) is valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses the stock price, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate to determine the fair value.</div><div></div><div>Warranty Costs</div><div></div><div>Our appliance hardware and software generally carry a warranty period of 90 days. Estimates of future warranty costs are based on historical returns and the application of the historical return rates to our in-warranty installed base. Warranty costs to repair or replace items sold to customers have been insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015.</div><div></div><div>Foreign Currency</div><div></div><div>The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in non-functional currencies are remeasured to the functional currency at the average exchange rate for the period. Non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses related to remeasurement are recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.</div><div></div><div>Income Taxes</div><div></div><div>We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or in our tax returns. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through an adjustment to income tax expense.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>74</div></div><div></div><div>The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. Assumptions represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. </div><div></div><div>We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our consolidated financial statements by regularly reviewing our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.</div><div></div><div>Segment Information</div><div></div><div>An operating segment is a component of an enterprise for which its discrete financial information is available and its operating results are regularly reviewed by chief operating decision maker for resource allocation decisions and performance assessment. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer.</div><div></div><div>Our Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company. Accordingly, we have onereportable segment and oneoperating segment.</div><div></div><div>Vendor Business Concentration </div><div></div><div>We rely on third parties to manufacture our hardware appliances and we purchase raw materials from third-party vendors. We outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing services to threeindependent manufacturers. In addition, we purchase certain strategic component inventory which is consigned to our third-party manufacturers. Other hardware components included in our products are sourced from various suppliers by our manufacturers and are principally industry standard parts and components that are available from multiple vendors. </div><div></div><div>Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers</div><div></div><div>Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held and invested in high-credit quality financial instruments by recognized financial institutions and therefore subject to minimum credit risk. </div><div></div><div>Our accounts receivable are unsecured and represent amounts due to us based on contractual obligations of our customers. We mitigate credit risk in respect to accounts receivable by performing periodic credit evaluations based on a number of factors, including past transaction experience, evaluation of credit history and review of the invoicing terms of the contract. We generally do not require our customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. </div><div></div><div>Significant customers, including distribution channel partners and direct customers, are those which represent more than 10% of our total revenue for each period presented, or our gross accounts receivable balance as of each respective balance sheet date.

Two customers account for26%and11%of our total gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015.</div><div></div><div>Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance</div><div></div><div>In the first quarter 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to </div><div></div><div><div>75</div></div><div></div><div>Employee Share -Based Payment Accounting. The primary tax impact of the adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to delay the recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces current taxes payable. The recognition of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. The unrecognized excess tax benefits of $3.4 millionas of January 1, 2017 had no impact on our accumulated deficit balance as we carried a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets. The new guidance also requires companies to record, subsequent to the adoption, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the period they arise. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. We adopted this change in presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statements of cash flows on a prospective basis. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employees shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. We elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeiture. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</div><div></div><div>Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective</div><div></div><div>In May 2014, the FASBissued ASU No. 2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which  supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration  that is expected to be received for the goods or services and requires the capitalization of incremental customer acquisition costs and amortization of these costs over the contract period or estimated customer life which will result in the recognition of a contract asset on our consolidated balance sheet. It also requires increased disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.</div><div></div><div>We will adopt Topic 606 effective January 1, 2018, applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. We expect to record a net reduction to opening accumulated deficit of $12.4million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606 as follows:</div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>A decrease in total deferred revenue of $4.0 millionprimarily due to the removal of the current limitation on contingent revenue that would have accelerated revenue recognition for certain of our historical revenue contracts; and </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Recognition of a deferred commissions asset of $8.4 milliondue to the requirement to recognize incremental customer acquisition costs in our consolidated statement of operations as the related performance obligations are met as compared to the current recognition to expense as incurred. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>In addition, the adoption of the standard does not have a significant impact to the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of operations, nor does it impact net cash provided by or used in operating, investing, or financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.</div><div></div><div>In February 2016, theFASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,Leases(Topic 842).This new accounting standardprimarily requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. In July 2018, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Topic 842 - Targeted Improvements. The update requires modified retrospective transition, with the option to initially apply the new standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment and elect various practical expedients. This standard is effectivefor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</div><div></div><div>In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04,Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the impairment loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This standard is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We do not believe this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</div><div></div><div></div><div><div>76</div></div><div></div><div>In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, to provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The amendments will be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. We do not believe this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</div><div></div><div>In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI).These amendments provide financial statement preparers with an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within AOCI to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recorded. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.</div><div></div><div>In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 118.These amendments add SEC guidance to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification regarding theTax Cuts and Jobs Actpursuant to the issuance of SAB 118. The amendments are effective upon addition to the FASB Codification. Disclosures related to the effect of theTax Cuts and Jobs Actand our  utilization of SAB 118 appear inNote 9 Income Taxes.</div><div></div><div>There have been no other recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that are of significance or potential significance to us.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>2. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements</div><div></div><div>Restatement Background</div><div></div><div>Subsequent to the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2017, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the Audit Committee) commenced an investigation (the Investigation) with the assistance of outside counsel relating to certain accounting and internal control matters at the Company, principally focused on certain revenue recognition matters from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2017 inclusive. The investigation was conducted with the assistance of outside counsel and independent counsel. Counsel retained forensic accountants to assist with their work. The investigation commenced following the identification of violations of the Company's Insider Trading Policy and Code of Conduct by a mid-level employee within the finance department, and as a result it was determined that further review and procedures relating to certain accounting and internal control matters should be undertaken. </div><div></div><div>During the course of this Investigation, code of conduct breaches and accounting and financial reporting errors were identified. The matters primarily resulted in modification to the timing of the recognition of revenue in a limited number of sale transactions between the Company and its resellers and distributors. The Company determined the need to restate the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company is also adjusting the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 to correct identified immaterial errors.</div><div></div><div>Revenue Recognition Adjustments</div><div></div><div>During the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue was recognized prematurely at the time, as it was determined that there was an oversight or misuse of facts which indicated that the resellers or distributors price was not fixed or determinable, or that collectability was not reasonably assured, because the resellers or distributors payment to the Company was contingent on resale of the product or the transaction included extended payment terms beyond the Companys customary terms. During the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue on certain sale transactions was recognized prematurely, as it was determined that there was an oversight of facts that indicated collectability was not reasonably assured, because the resellers or distributors payment to the Company was contingent on resale of the product or the transaction included extended payment terms beyond the Companys customary terms.</div><div></div><div>To correct these errors, the related revenue and cost of revenue were reversed in the period in which the accounting errors took place and, except for one 2016 transaction, have been recognized in subsequent periods when all of the revenue recognition criteria were met. Additionally, certain adjustments to reverse accounts receivable, net of allowances, recognize </div><div></div><div><div>77</div></div><div></div><div>inventory, and adjust deferred revenue, current, were made to the consolidated balance sheet at the end of the period in which the accounting errors occurred.</div><div></div><div>Other Adjustments</div><div></div><div>In addition to the restatement adjustments described above, we have identified other revenue and expense classification errors that are not material, individually or in the aggregate that have been corrected in connection with the restatement.</div><div></div><div>Tax effect of restatement adjustments   </div><div></div><div>The Company recorded adjustments to its deferred taxes as a result of the restatement.The overall impact of the restatement is an increase to deferred taxes with the corresponding increase to the valuation allowance with no impact to the effective tax rate or income tax expense.

When the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities minus outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit equals or exceeds $50.0 million, loans may be advanced under the 2016 Credit Facility up to the full $25.0 million. When our net cash falls below $50.0 million, loans may be advanced under the 2016 Credit Facility based on a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable. The loans bear interest, at our option, at (i) the prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal, minus0.50%or (ii) a LIBOR rate determined in accordance with the 2016 Credit Facility, plus2.50%. We are required to pay customary closing fees, commitment fees and letter of credit fees for a facility of this size and type.        </div><div>Our obligations under the 2016 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property.

We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.</div><div></div><div><div>84</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>On June 24, 2015, our directors and certain of our officers were named as defendants in a putative derivative lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, captionedHornung v.

of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of these assets is more likely than not. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods, we recorded a full valuation allowance of $72.5 million, $88.1 millionand $78.3 millionagainst the U.S. net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, the valuation allowance decreased by $15.6 million, increased by $9.8 millionand increased by $14.7 million,  respectively. </div><div></div><div>In the first quarter 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share -Based Payment Accounting. The primary tax impact of the adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to delay the recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces current taxes payable. The recognition of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits was adopted on a modified retrospective basis. The unrecognized excess tax benefits of $3.4 millionas of January 1, 2017 had no impact on our accumulated deficit balance as we carried a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets. The new guidance also requires companies to record, subsequent to the adoption, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the period they arise. In addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. We adopted this change in presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statements of cash flows on a prospective basis.</div><div></div><div>As of December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $152.3 million,  $143.3 millionand $134.7 million, and state net operating loss carryforwards of $73.6 million, $70.1 millionand $69.1 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year ending December31, 2027, if not utilized. The state net operating losses expire in various years ending between 2018and 2037, if not utilized. </div><div></div><div>Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, we had U.S. federal research and development credit carryforwards of $10.3 million, $8.5 millionand $6.4 million, and state research and development credit carryforwards of $10.9 million, $8.8 millionand $6.4 million, respectively. The federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2025while the state credit carryforwards can be carried over indefinitely.</div><div></div><div>Utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation provided for in the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state codes. Any annual limitation could result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before utilization.</div><div></div><div>With respect to our undistributed foreign subsidiaries earnings we consider those earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no related provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment </div><div></div><div><div>92</div></div><div></div><div>for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes in the various countries. As of December 31, 2017, 2016and 2015, the undistributed earnings approximated$8.4 million, $5.1 millionand $3.9 million, respectively.

The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35percent to 21percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.</div><div></div><div>On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) was issued, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a companys accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act. Our accounting for all effects of the Tax Act is incomplete. However, we were able to make reasonable estimates of certain effects and, therefore, have recorded provisional amounts to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.</div><div></div><div>Within the Tax Act, the Transition Act imposes a tax (Transition Tax) on the untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies by deeming those earnings to be repatriated. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the Transition Tax on our non-U.S. earnings. Foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 15.5% rate and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8.0% rate. In calculating the Transition Tax, the Company must calculate the cumulative earnings and profits of each of the non-U.S. subsidiaries back to 1987. The Company expects to complete this </div><div></div><div><div>93</div></div><div></div><div>calculation and record any tax due by the end of fiscal 2018. Based on a preliminary analysis, and as a result of the Companys significant tax attributes, the Companys provisional estimate has no impact on the income tax provision. </div><div></div><div>The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the Tax Act on its financial statements and operations. Any additional impacts of the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.</div><div></div><div>Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is complete.</div><div></div><div>We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The rate reduction would generally take effect on January 1, 2018. Consequently, any changes in the U.S. corporate income tax rate will impact the carrying value of our deferred tax assets. Under the new corporate income tax rate of 21%, U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets decreased by approximately $28.2 millionand the valuation allowance has decreased by the same amount. </div><div></div><div>Our accounting for the following elements of the Tax Act is incomplete, and we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the effects. Therefore, no provisional adjustments were recorded.</div><div></div><div>The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&amp;P) for which we have previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. This had no impact on the liability for our foreign subsidiaries or income tax expense. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&amp;P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.</div><div></div><div>Global intangible low taxed income (GILTI): The Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e., GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) must be included currently in the gross income of the CFCs U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the shareholders net CFC tested income over the net deemed tangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1) 10%of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholders pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. </div><div></div><div>Because of the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the Tax Act and the application of ASC 740. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current period expense when incurred (the period cost method) or (2) factoring such amounts into a companys measurement of its deferred taxes (the deferred method). Our selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new GILTI tax rules will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. Because whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI depends on not only our current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also our intent and ability to modify our structure and/or our business, we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of the Tax Act. Therefore, we have not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI.</div><div></div><div>We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states, and several foreign jurisdictions. In November 2017, the Internal Revenue Service completed its examination for our 2015 and 2014 tax returns with no changes to the reported tax. Because we have net operating loss and credit carryforwards, there are open statutes of limitations in which federal, state and foreign taxing authorities may examine our tax returns for all years from 2004through the current period.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><div>94</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>10.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES </div><div></div><div>Audit Committee Investigation</div><div>As reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on July 2, 2018 and described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the Audit Committee) completed and made findings with respect to the investigation that was previously disclosed on January 30, 2018. </div><div>Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</div><div>Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits to the SEC, under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to enable timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</div><div>In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.</div><div>Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017, due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses as of December 31, 2017, management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, and in conformity with U.S. GAAP our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.</div><div>Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</div><div>Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that:</div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Are designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Our internal control over financial reporting is designed by, and under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management, and others. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of </div><div></div><div><div>96</div></div><div></div><div>any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with internal control policies or procedures may deteriorate.</div><div>Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, using the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.</div><div>In connection with managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting described above, management identified deficiencies that constituted individually, or in the aggregate, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017:  </div><div>Material Weaknesses Identified</div><div>Control Environment and Monitoring Activities- We did not maintain an effective control environment.</div><div>Specifically, our control environment, which sets the tone of our organization, and influences the control consciousness of employees, did not consistently ensure that the Companys policies relating to revenue recognition and standards of conduct were affirmatively understood and followed and that deviations therefrom were consistently identified and corrected in a timely manner or hold certain individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities in the pursuit of Company objectives. Further, at certain levels within certain functions, there were insufficient monitoring activities to determine certain components of internal control were present and functioning. </div><div></div><div>The control environment material weaknesses contributed to the revenue recognition material weaknesses described below.</div><div>Revenue Recognition -We identified the following material weaknesses with respect to revenue recognition:</div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Certain personnel in our credit and accounting functions did not have the adequate expertise to design and operate certain internal controls, to formalize certain appropriate policies and procedures, or to communicate matters relevant to revenue recognition. Certain personnel in our sales and sales operations functions did not have the adequate expertise to identify and communicate to accounting personnel certain information relevant to revenue recognition. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Certain policies and procedures were not sufficiently detailed to establish expectations for and to support effective design and operation of internal controls in our sales, credit, and accounting functions to consistently determine whether our resellers or distributors price was fixed or determinable, or that collectability was reasonably assured in every case, and that once determined, adequate documentation was maintained.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>The material weaknesses described above resulted in errors that led to the restatement of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Furthermore, these control deficiencies could have resulted in other misstatements in financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not have been prevented or detected.</div><div>Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting</div><div>Except for the material weaknesses described above, no other change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. </div><div>Remediation Actions Relating to Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</div><div>At the conclusion of its investigation, the Audit Committee recommended to management a number of remediation actions. With the oversight of the Audit Committee, management is committed to the planning and implementing of these remediation actions to address the material weaknesses identified, as well as to foster continuous improvement in the Companys internal controls. The Company has implemented or is in the process of implementing various initiatives intended to address the identified material weaknesses and strengthen our overall internal control environment. In this regard, some of  our key remedial initiatives include:</div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Executive Management Communications to Reinforce Compliance- The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, at the direction of the Companys Board of Directors, have in communications to personnel </div></td></tr></table><div></div><div><div>97</div></div><div></div><div>reinforced the importance of adherence to the Companys policies and procedures regarding ethics and compliance and the importance of identifying misconduct and raising and communicating concerns. </div><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Changes to Our Executive Management and Sales Personnel - The Company has hired new personnel, who have enabled improved lines of communication across business functions and increased expertise.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Training Practices- The Company has initiated development of a comprehensive training program relating to revenue recognition and contract review. </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Credit Policies and Procedures- The Company has evaluated its practices regarding extension of credit to customers and evaluation of customer creditworthiness and has begun implementing improvements in those practices.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Revenue Recognition Policies and Procedures- The Company has evaluated its revenue recognition policies and procedures and has begun implementing improvements, including: </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(i)</div></td><td><div>the development of more comprehensive revenue recognition policies and improved procedures to ensure that such policies are understood and consistently applied; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(ii)</div></td><td><div>better communication among functions involved in the sales process, including credit, accounting, sales, and sales operations; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(iii)</div></td><td><div>increased standardization of contract documentation and revenue analyses for individual transactions, including increased oversight of revenue opportunities and contract review by personnel with the requisite accounting knowledge; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(iv)</div></td><td><div>the development of a more comprehensive review process for, and monitoring controls over, customer contracts to ensure accurate revenue recognition, and the preparation of accounting memoranda to document the foregoing; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(v)</div></td><td><div>the development of more comprehensive policies and procedures for product shipment and delivery documentation; </div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(vi)</div></td><td><div>the adoption of enhancements of policies and procedures for approval of non-standard revenue arrangements with reseller and distributor customers; and</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div>(vii)</div></td><td><div>the adoption of revised documentation, including the Companys sales quotations, to identify additional information relevant to revenue recognition.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><div></div></td><td><div>Implementation and Enhancement of Entity Level Controls - The Company intends to implement additional controls in its quarterly/annual financial reporting process, including enhanced sub-certifications by all sales personnel and with specific documentation related to the identification of non-standard revenue arrangements. The Company also intends to enhance its insider trading policy and related communications to employees.</div></td></tr></table><div></div><div>Our management has worked, and continues to work, to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We are committed to ensuring that such controls are designed and operating effectively. The identified material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management concludes, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As we continue to evaluate and improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify or change the proposed remediation measures described above.</div><div>Our Board of Directors and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of the Companys financial statements seriously and believe that the steps taken, and to be taken, to remediate the identified material weaknesses were and are essential steps to maintaining strong and effective internal control over financial reporting and a strong internal control environment.</div><div>Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls</div><div>Our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control </div><div></div><div><div>98</div></div><div></div><div>systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.</div><div></div><div></div><div>\u00b0Item"

We have designed and implemented processes to manage risk in our operations. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the company faces, while our board of directors, as a whole and assisted by its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are appropriate and functioning as designed.</div><div></div><div>Our board of directors believes that open communication between management and our board of directors is essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our board of directors meets with our Chief Executive Officer and other members of the senior management team at quarterly meetings of our board of directors, where, among other topics, they discuss strategy and risks facing the company, as well as at such other times as they deemed appropriate.</div><div></div><div>While our board of directors is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, our board committees assist our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. Our audit committee assists our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management in the areas of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, legal and regulatory compliance, and discusses with management and the independent auditor guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Our audit committee also reviews our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. Our audit committee also monitors certain key risks on a regular basis throughout the fiscal year, such as risk associated with internal control over financial reporting and liquidity risk. Our nominating and corporate governance committee assists our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risk associated with board organization, membership and structure, and corporate governance. Our compensation committee assesses risks created by the incentives inherent in our compensation policies. Finally, our full board of directors reviews strategic and operational risk in the context of reports from the management team, receives reports on all significant committee activities at each regular meeting, and evaluates the risks inherent in significant transactions.</div><div>Section16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance</div><div></div><div>Section16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC. Such directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section16(a) forms they file.</div><div></div><div>SEC regulations require us to identify in this Annual Report on Form 10-K anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent fiscal year. Based on our review of forms we received, or written representations from reporting persons stating that they were not required to file these forms, we believe that during our fiscal ended December31, 2017, all Section16(a) filing requirements were satisfied on a timely basis.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><div>104</div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\u00b0Item"

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION </div><div>Processes and Procedures for Compensation Decisions</div><div></div><div>Our compensation committee is responsible for the executive compensation programs for our executive officers and reports to our board of directors on its discussions, decisions and other actions. Typically, our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our compensation committee regarding, and often attends committee meetings relating to the determination of, compensation for the respective executive officers that report to him, except that our Chief Executive Officer does not make recommendations as to his own compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our compensation committee regarding short- and long-term compensation for all executive officers (other than himself) based on our results, an individual executive officers contribution toward these results and performance toward individual goal achievement. Our compensation committee then reviews the recommendations and other data and makes decisions as to total compensation for each executive officer other than the Chief Executive Officer, as well as each individual compensation component. Our compensation committee makes recommendations to our board of directors regarding compensation for our Chief Executive Officer. The independent members of our board of directors make the final decisions regarding executive compensation for our Chief Executive Officer.</div><div></div><div>Our compensation committee is authorized to retain the services of one or more executive compensation advisors, as it sees fit, in connection with the establishment of our compensation programs and related policies. Compensia, a national compensation consultant, has been retained by our compensation committee to provide information, recommendations and other advice relating to executive compensation. Compensia was engaged to assist our compensation committee in developing an appropriate group of peer companies to help us determine the appropriate level of overall compensation for our executive officers, as well as assess each separate element of compensation, with a goal of ensuring that the compensation we offer to our executive officers is competitive and fair.</div><div>Fiscal 2017 Summary Compensation Table </div><div></div><div>The following table provides information regarding the total compensation for services rendered in all capacities that was earned by each individual who served as our principal executive officer at any time in 2017, and our two other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers as of December31, 2017.

Our Bonus Plan allows our compensation committee to provide cash incentive awards to selected employees, including our NEOs, based upon performance goals established by our compensation committee.</div><div></div><div>Under the Bonus Plan, our compensation committee determines the performance goals applicable to awards, which goals may include, without limitation: attainment of research and development milestones, sales bookings, business divestitures and acquisitions, cash flow, cash position, earnings (which may include any calculation of earnings, including but not limited to earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and net earnings), earnings per share, net income, net profit, net sales, operating cash flow, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, overhead or other expense reduction, product defect measures, product release timelines, productivity, profit, return on assets, return on capital, return on equity, return on investment, return on sales, revenue, revenue growth, sales results, sales growth, stock price, time to market, total stockholder return, working capital, and individual objectives such as peer reviews or other subjective or objective criteria.  Performance goals that include the Companys financial results may be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, or such financial results may consist of non-GAAP financial measures and any actual results may be adjusted by our compensation committee for one-time items or unbudgeted or unexpected items when determining whether the performance goals have been met. The goals may be on the basis of any factors our compensation committee determines relevant, and may be adjusted on an individual, divisional, business unit or company-wide basis. Any criteria used may be measured on such basis as our compensation committee determines. The performance goals may differ from participant to participant and from award to award.</div><div></div><div>Our compensation committee may, in its sole discretion and at any time, increase, reduce or eliminate a participants actual award, and/or increase, reduce or eliminate the amount allocated to the bonus pool for a particular performance period. The actual award may be below, at or above a participants target award, in our compensation committees discretion. Our compensation committee may determine the amount of any reduction on the basis of such factors as it deems relevant, and it is not required to establish any allocation or weighting with respect to the factors it considers.</div><div></div><div>Actual awards are paid in cash (or its equivalent) in a single lump sum only after they are earned and approved by our compensation committee. Unless otherwise determined by our compensation committee, to earn an actual award, a participant must be employed by the Company (or an affiliate of the Company) through the date the bonus is paid. Payment of bonuses occurs as soon as administratively practicable after they are earned, but no later than the dates set forth in the Bonus Plan.</div><div></div><div>Our board of directors has the authority to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Bonus Plan provided such action does not alter or impair the existing rights of any participant with respect to any earned bonus.</div><div>Retirement Plan</div><div></div><div>We maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan for all employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements under the plan. The plan provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. Participants of our 401(k) plan are able to defer a percentage of their eligible compensation, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code and plan limits.  All participants interests in their deferrals are 100% vested when contributed. We also provide matching contributions under our 401(k) plan that generally vest over a 4-year period based on the participants employment. The Company matches 50% of the first 6% of eligible compensation contributed, for up to $2,500 per year. Pre-tax contributions are allocated to the participants individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants directions. The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Internal Revenue Code Section401(a) with the plans related trust intended to be tax exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section501(a). As a tax-qualified retirement plan, the 401(k) plan allows contributions, and earnings on those contributions, not to be taxable to the employees until distributed from

We believe the terms of the transactions described above were comparable to terms we could have obtained in arms-length dealings with unrelated third parties. </div><div>Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions</div><div></div><div>The audit committee of our board of directors has the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving transactions with related parties. Our audit committee charter provides that the audit committee may review and approve in advance any related party transactions.</div><div></div><div>We have adopted a formal written policy providing that our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our common stock, any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, and any firm, corporation, or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed, is a general partner or principal or in a similar position, or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest, is not permitted to enter into a related party transaction with us without the consent of our audit committee, subject to the exceptions described below. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to our audit committee, including, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, and the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction.  Our audit committee has determined that certain transactions shall be deemed to be pre-approved by the audit committee, even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed $120,000, including certain employment arrangements of executive officers, director compensation, transactions with another company at which a related partys only relationship is as a non-executive employee or beneficial owner of less than 5% of that companys shares, transactions where a related partys interest arises solely from the ownership of our common stock and all holders of our common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis, and transactions available to all employees generally.</div><div>Director Independence</div><div></div><div>Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed companys board of directors. In addition, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed companys audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of that listed companys board of directors, that director does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.</div><div></div><div>Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.</div><div></div><div>Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that Messrs.Braham, Chung, Henricks and Salsbury do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is independent as that term is defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of </div><div></div><div><div>115</div></div><div></div><div>our capital stock by each non-employee director, and the transactions involving them described in the section titled Related Party Transactions.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>\u00b0Item"
