            "8x8 is a leading cloud provider of enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) communications solutions, that enable businesses of all sizes to communicate faster and smarter across voice, video meetings, chat and contact centers, transforming both employee and customer experiences with communications that work simply, integrate seamlessly, and perform reliably. From one proprietary cloud technology platform, customers have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics and other services.",
            "We believe that 8x8 is emerging from being the industrys best kept secret. Unlike our cloud communication competitors, 8x8 owns its complete technology stack, built over twenty years of company investment and supported by over 170 technology patents. Our cloud communications and collaboration solutions are designed for easy deployment, management, and use, operating across multiple devices and locations for any business workflow or global environment. Built from core cloud technologies that we own and manage internally, our solution enables 8x8 customers to rely on one provider for their global communications, video meetings, contact center and customer support requirements.",
            "The 8x8 technology platform provides customers with key technology integrations within their existing infrastructure. Companies are looking to increase their competitive edge by integrating their communications with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Human Capital Management (HCM) applications, and other back-office IT (information technology) systems within their infrastructure. Further complicating matters, business users are circumventing their IT departments by using a variety of self-selected third-party tools for team communication and collaboration, driving a shift in the buying center for communications and collaboration from IT to individuals, a phenomenon known in the industry as \"shadow IT.\" 8x8 integrates across CRM/ERP (such as Netsuite or Bullhorn), service and support (such as Zendesk or Salesforce sales cloud), and other productivity/collaboration tools (slack or G-suite, for example), providing seamless access, unified analytics, and business flexibility to 8x8 customers. This is supported by 8x8 through its data security and compliance certifications, including HIPAA, FISMA and ISO 27001,which meet or exceed the requirements of government and industry agencies around the world.",
            "Many other legacy business processes have already experienced the move to the cloud phenomenon. Examples include companies using legacy front office applications switching to cloud providers like Salesforce.com, Inc., or the use of IT management applications migrating to industry disruptors such as Servicenow, Inc. Business communications applications are following suit as the next major business segment to migrate to the cloud. Businesses today face increasing cost and complexity with deployments of communications and collaboration solutions. Companies of all sizes are managing a global, distributed workforce that seeks to leverage multiple forms of communication in their day-to-day interactions. The rapid rise of mobile devices in the enterprise has created demand for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) integration as part of a typical business' communications needs. We believe that 8x8 is an industry disruptor (in the same vein as Salesforce was for front office applications or Servicenow was for IT applications), across three large markets: unified communications, video meeting solutions, and contact center applications. Our platform, which offers capabilities and functionality across all three areas in one integrated technology stack provides a complete cloud offering that enhances productivity and business insight. Combining these services allows our customers to eliminate information silos and expose vital, real-time communications data spanning multiple services, applications and devices which, in turn, can improve productivity, business performance and customer experience.",
            "Traditionally, small businesses were the first to transition their communications to the cloud starting several years ago, due to cost effectiveness, ease of deployment and inherent flexibility. Mid-market and Enterprise sized companies that have adopted cloud-based solutions for other applications and processes are increasingly looking to modernize their communications in a similar fashion. We believe this adoption is being driven by the convergence of several market trends, including the increasing costs of maintaining installed legacy communications systems; the fragmentation resulting from varied use of multiple on-premises systems or point cloud solutions, which has worsened as workforces have become more distributed and international; and the proliferation of personal mobile devices in the workplace.",
            "We have more than 1 million business users. Our customers are spread across more than 150 countries and range from small businesses to large enterprises with more than 10,000 employees. In recent years, we have increased our focus on the mid-market and enterprise customer sectors. In fiscal 2019, we experienced consistent top line revenue growth and the majority of our accelerated service revenue growth from customers of these business sizes.",
            "We offer a highly scalable and configurable cloud communications platform comprising voice, video meetings, chat and team collaboration, contact center, and analytics for businesses of all sizes across the globe. With voice, video conferencing, team messaging and contact center integrated as one platform, customers can start out with just phone service and then roll out the additional capabilities when ready. The key attributes of the 8x8 solution include:",
            "We are committed to developing and delivering the most innovative, reliable, scalable and secure cloud communications software for global business communications. Our strategy is informed by evolving market dynamics and a broad market focus across all customer sectors, along with the unique attributes of our technology.",
            "Key elements of our strategy include:",
            "Powered by one fully owned technology stack, 8x8's solutions serve businesses of all sizes,and can be readily configured to serve large, globally distributed enterprise customers. All of our core software components work together and can be combined into different bundles depending on the business needs of our customers.",
            "Over the course of fiscal 2019, we offered a variety of stand alone services and offerings:",
            "simple, personalized and customizable communications experiences, including communications control, external data source integration and intelligent routing.",
            "The capabilities of these stand-alone services are integrated into a comprehensive offering called 8x8 X Series. We began releasing integrated service suites during our fiscal 2018 with offerings such as Virtual Office X8 Editions. During fiscal 2019, we accelerated the transition by delivering the X Series platform and driving adoption to more than 10,000 new customers. X Series service plans are designed so customers pay for only those capabilities the business needs.",
            "Designated X1 through X8, we offer the following service plans and capabilities in the 8x8 X Series:",
            "The result is a communication, meeting, and contact center engagement platform that enables businesses to move at the speed of employee and customer expectations, leading to less churn and more revenue.",
            "We introduced our first communications SaaS offering in 2002, and have since heavily invested in expanding our platform, solutions, features and capabilities. Our services are powered by internally-owned and operated technologies and are delivered to our customers from our micro services based cloud communications platform. We hold more than 170 United States patents covering a variety of voice and video communications, signaling, processing, analytics, and storage technologies. Many of our current patents apply to the communications software used in our various SaaS solutions.",
            "We developed our Global Reach patented technology with the goal of ensuring that 8x8 voice communications, placed or received anywhere on the globe on any compatible device, can have the same consistent quality as a local call within a single area code. Many hosted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions route call data through the same, predetermined data center, regardless of the physical or geographic location of callers. By contrast, when an end-user makes a call using our solution, our patented technology seeks out the closest data center to the caller's location, subject to service quality, security and data sovereignty considerations. We call this \"geo-routing.\" Our proprietary technologies take into account current Internet and carrier network conditions and determine the best route virtually instantaneously, ensuring that latency is minimized within the available routing options.",
            "Our software solutions provide mission critical services to our business customers. Therefore, we have developed technologies and cloud native architectures that ensure high reliability and uptime of our services.",
            "We believe one of the key areas that differentiates 8x8 from our competitors is the quality of our real-time service delivery over the public Internet. Real-time voice is perhaps the most difficult application to be delivered over the public Internet as there is no time for retransmission and there is little buffering that can be done without impacting the quality of a real-time ",
            "conversation. As such, quality of the connection well beyond just the available bandwidth is the most important element of service delivery for VoIP. By having diverse routes and connectivity as well as full and granular Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) control over these connections, 8x8 is constantly inspecting the state of the Internet to optimize our service delivery to customers.",
            "In addition, we have instrumented hundreds of thousands of 8x8 endpoints to provide details of quality of connection information at the end of each call to 8x8's internal network operations big data environment. The results of data analytics over this data set is used by our operations and support teams to optimize the delivery of the service as well as reduce impact of carrier outages on our customers. This is possible due to our full control over the core networking stack and the transit connections in our data centers. ",
            "Furthermore, we have been leveraging public cloud infrastructure services such as Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as an important part of our infrastructure expansion strategy to increase the velocity of innovation and value delivery to our customers. This is done by taking advantage of the elasticity and power of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as well as artificial intelligence/machine learning capabilities of AWS and GCP for many of our microservices and services such as storage (for data sovereignty), analytics, integration framework and quality management.",
            "In fiscal 2019, we invested heavily in scaling, testing and expanding our platform globally. This is made possible by heavy investment in automation, continuous deployment and continuous integration tools and associated processes. Embracing the latest trends in the software development and operations (DevOps) culture, these investments included focusing on containerization of our applications and utilizing kubernetes for orchestration to automate the deployment and rapid scaling of our containerized applications globally consistently across public cloud and our own data centers. Our one platform and microservices infrastructure, allows our operations to roll-out new services quickly and efficiently to all of our customers and further allows us to scale, manage, and maintain our platform cost-effectively.",
            "Our technologies include a number of deployment methodologies that promote consistency and efficiency in the implementation of our services, while driving customer adoption of our more advanced software features. We also manage and port existing business numbers globally, and we provide local number porting services in more than 40 countries. Our software provides connectivity to emergency services and other services required by telecommunications regulations in different regions of the world. We have developed our own proprietary billing software which is closely integrated with our offerings.",
            "We have developed a set of data processing and analytics technologies to respond to the needs of global enterprise customers. Our analytics solutions are developed on a purpose-made, in-house-built real time analytics platform. The same one platform is used for unified communication and contact center customers. The data and insights from the system are available in home grown reports as well as dashboards and wallboards. Our large customers are also able to request (API) access to data in order to allow them to embed 8x8 datasets in their own analytics driven processes and tools.",
            "Finally, a key aspect of our technology, especially critical for larger enterprise customers and certain industry verticals, such as healthcare, is our emphasis on security and compliance, which we have addressed through specific measures such as our end-to-end encryption technologies and certifications with various regulations and industry standards.",
            "Sales, Marketing and Promotional Activities",
            "We market our services directly to end users through a variety of means, including search engine marketing and optimization, third-party lead generation sources, industry conferences, trade shows, webinars, and digital advertising channels. We employ a direct sales organization, consisting of inside and field-based sales agents, and we partner with an indirect channel partner network consisting of master agents and the sub agent community, value-added resellers (VARs), independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators and service providers. We typically contract directly with the end customer and use these channel partners to identify, qualify and manage prospects throughout the sales cycle, although we also have arrangements with a number of partners who resell our services to their own customers, with whom we do not contract directly. For mid-market and enterprise customers, our sales professionals work closely with inside technical support, sales engineers and deployment specialists to develop customized solution proposals based on individual customer requirements.",
            "In fiscal 2019, we continued to invest in new and unique demand generation tools and programs. For our direct and channel teams, we hosted customers and partners at\"8x8 Experience Roadshow\", a series of conferences held across several cities to share recent product developments and hear customer feedback first-hand. For our channel partners, we began the Elev8 program to visit and enable sub-agents with tools and training to effectively sell 8x8 solutions. We also launched 8x8 Partner Xchange, a new online portal that enables channel partners to effectively and efficiently manage their 8x8-related business and drive sales of 8x8 solutions. PartnerXchange is a single platform that makes it easier for partners to do business with 8x8 globally. We also continued to invest in developing partner deployment and support certification programs. We believe the 8x8 partner channel strategy has been a critical component of our strategy for winning large and mid-market enterprise business. In this most recent fiscal year, we significantly focused on strengthening those relationships and enhancing our global partner program to drive channel onboarding, enablement, and customer sales.",
            "Given the size and stage of the current market opportunity and the breadth of our communications platform, we face competition from many companies, including other cloud services providers, communications and collaboration software vendors and incumbent telephone companies and other resellers of legacy communications equipment. For more information regarding the risks associated with such competition, please refer to our \"Risk Factors\" below.",
            "Cloud Communications and Contact Center Services Providers",
            "For customers looking to implement cloud-based communications, we compete with other cloud communication and contact center service providers such as RingCentral, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., Zoom Video Communications, Inc., Fuze, Inc., Five9, Inc., and NICE inContact. We believe that the integration of our services over a common platform, including contact center, differentiates our services from those offered by these competitors.",
            "Large and Disruptive Internet and Cloud Services Vendors",
            "We also face competition from communications and collaboration software vendors such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Google, Inc., Amazon Web Services, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Slack, Inc., some of which are well established in the communications industry while others have only recently begun to market cloud communications solutions. Some of these competitors have developed strong software solutions for its respective communications and/or collaboration silo. Many of these competitors are substantially larger, better capitalized, and more well-known than we are. However, we believe that a collective deployment of these software solutions is likely to be more expensive and cumbersome for customers, when compared to similar deployments of our services. ",
            "Incumbent Telephony Companies and Legacy Equipment Providers",
            "Our cloud-based software replaces wire line business voice services sold by incumbent telephone and cable companies such as AT&amp;T, Inc., CenturyLink, Inc., Comcast Corporation, and Verizon Communications, Inc. often in conjunction with on-premises hardware solutions from companies like Avaya, Inc., Ciscoand Mitel Networks Corp. We believe that the solutions offered by these competitors are typically more expensive to adopt, require cumbersome on-premises implementations, and need regular hardware and IT infrastructure upgrades. Furthermore, the offerings often do not provide all the functionality needed for larger customers to integrate their communication systems with their IT infrastructure, therefore requiring additional system integration investments.",
            "Our operations infrastructure consists of data management, monitoring, control, and billing systems that support all of our products and services. We have invested substantial resources to develop and implement our real-time call management information system. Key elements of our operations infrastructure include a prospective customer quotation portal, customer provisioning, customer access, fraud control, network security, call routing, call monitoring, media processing and normalization, call reliability, detailed call record storage and billing and integration with third-party applications. We maintain a call-switching platform in software that manages call admission, call control and call rating and routes calls to an appropriate destination or customer premises equipment.",
            "We maintain global network operations centers at our headquarters in San Jose, California and in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and employ experienced staff in voice and data operations in US, UK, and Romania to provide 24-hour operations support, seven days per week. We use various tools including an extensive set of synthetic tests and Application Performance Monitoring (APMs) to monitor and manage elements of our network and our partners' networks in real time. We also monitor the network elements of some of our larger business customers. Additionally, our network operations centers provide technical support to ",
            "troubleshoot equipment and network problems. We also rely upon the network operations centers and resources of our telecommunications carrier partners and data center providers to augment our monitoring and response efforts.",
            "In the event of a major disruption at a data center, such as a natural disaster, failover between data centers for 8x8 Virtual Office and 8x8 X Series is designed to occur almost instantly and with minimal disruption. In addition, most of the maintenance services performed by 8x8 do not interrupt the service we provide to customers. For example, we can move the core call flow processing from one data center to another without dropping a call. We offer local redundancy (i.e., failover to a data center within the same region) as a standard feature of 8x8 Virtual Contact Center and X Series, and geographical redundancy (i.e., failover to a data center in a different region) can be enabled as an option to provision geo-redundant tenants on multiple sites.",
            "8x8 maintains a global customer support organization with operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, Singapore, and Romania. Customers can access 8x8 customer support services directly from the company website, or receive multi-channel technical support via phone, chat, web and email. Emergency support is available on a 24x7 basis.",
            "We take a lifecycle approach to customer support, supporting customers from onboarding to deployment and training, and through the renewal process, to drive greater user adoption of 8x8 services. For our larger enterprise customers, our Elite Touch implementation methodology utilizes a Deployment Management team and provides active support through the \"go-live\" date at each customer site. We also have an Elite Customer Success Program, and, for a certain profile of customer, a dedicated Customer Success Manager, as a single point of contact for every aspect of the post-sale relationship. Finally, we offer a variety of training classes through our 8x8 Academy, either through instructor-led classes or self-paced on-line learning.",
            "We are a party to telecommunications interconnect and service agreements with VoIP providers and public switched telephone network (PSTN) telecommunications carriers in the United States and other global regions. Pursuant to these agreements, VoIP calls originating on our network can be terminated on other VoIP networks or the PSTN, and likewise, calls originating on other VoIP networks and the PSTN can be terminated on our network.",
            "The cloud communications market is characterized by rapid technological changes and advancements, typical of most SaaS markets. Accordingly, we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and services, as well as the development of enhancements and features to our existing products and services, and make these enhancements available to our customers frequently. Research and development expenses in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017were $62.1 million, $36.4 million, and $29.0 million, respectively.",
            "We plan to continue to invest in expanding the set of services within our platform, including extending our contact center capabilities, adding deeper collaboration services, and bringing an increasing number of analytics-driven applications to market. Our development programs continue to focus on the integration and functionality of our products and services with other SaaS services, such as Microsoft Teams, ServiceNow, Google's GSuite, Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Zendesk and others. We also plan to continue investing in our AI and ML research, to develop more intelligent features for our services.",
            "We currently employ individuals in research, development and engineering activities in our facilities in San Jose, California, London, England and Cluj-Napoca, Romania as well as outsourced software development consultants.",
            "In the United States, VoIP and other software communications and collaboration services, like ours, have been subject to less regulation at the state and federal levels than traditional telecommunications services. TheFederal Communications Commission (FCC) has subjected VoIP service providers to a subset of the regulations that apply to traditional telecommunications service providers and has not yet classified VoIP services as either telecommunications or information. The FCC is currently examining the status of VoIP service providers and the services they provide in multiple open proceedings.",
            "Many state regulatory agencies impose taxes and other surcharges on VoIP services, and certain states take the position that offerings by VoIP providers are intrastate telecommunications services and therefore subject to state regulation. These states argue that if the beginning and end points of communications are known, and if some of these communications occur entirely within the boundaries of a state, the state can regulate that offering. We believe that federal regulations largely pre-empt state regulations that treat VoIP offerings in the same manner as providers of traditional telecommunications services. However, there are many areas of regulation where pre-emption has not been resolved as a matter of law. It is possible that the FCC could determine that VoIP services are not information services, or that there could be a judicial or legislative determination that the ",
            "states are not pre-empted from regulating VoIP services as traditional telecommunications services. We cannot predict how or when these issues will be resolved or the potential future impact on our business at this time.",
            "In addition to regulations addressing Internet telephony and broadband services, other regulatory issues relating to the Internet generally could affect our ability to provide our services. Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. In addition, a number of initiatives pending in Congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the Internet, which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the Internet generally.Certain states are also enacting privacy legislation. In particular, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which is scheduled to go into effect January 1, 2020.The CCPA imposes new obligations on for profit companies, including us, doing business in California with annual gross revenue in excess of $25 million, and substantially increases potential liability for such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules applicable to California residents.",
            "Internationally, we are subject to a complex patchwork of regulations that vary from country to country. Some countries have adopted laws that make the provision of VoIP services illegal within the country. Other countries have adopted laws that impose stringent licensing obligations on providers of VoIP services like ours. In many countries, it is not clear how laws that have historically been applied to traditional telecommunications providers will be applied to providers of VoIP services like us. On May 4, 2016, theEuropean Union (EU) formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR imposes new obligations on all companies, including us, and substantially increases potential liability for all companies, including us, for failure to comply with data protection rules.",
            "The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders, or any changes in existing laws or their enforcement, on our operations cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers. An increase in these costs could make our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services, if we increase our prices, or decrease our profit margins, if we attempt to absorb such costs.",
            "Federal, state, local and foreign governmental organizations are considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate and/or tax applications running over the Internet. We cannot predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending on the type of taxes imposed, whether and how our services would be affected thereafter. ",
            "Please refer to Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" for a discussion of additional regulatory risks, proceedings and issues that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the future.",
            "Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights",
            "Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property protection for our technology in the United States and internationally. We currently rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. We currently hold more than 170 United States patents, which we expect to expire between 2019and 2036. We have additional patent applications pending. We cannot predict whether our pending patent applications will result in issued patents.",
            "To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require our employees to sign agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and also the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that competition will not independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around any of our patents. In addition, the laws of foreign countries in which our products and services are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information could cause our business and operating results to suffer.",
            "We are also subject to the risks of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Such claims and litigation could require us to expend substantial resources and distract key employees from their normal duties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The communications and software industries are subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Moreover, the VoIP service provider community has historically been a target of patent holders. There is a risk that we will be a target of assertions of patent rights and that we may be required to expend significant resources to investigate and defend against such assertions of patent rights. For information about specific claims, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Our infringement of a third party's proprietary technology could disrupt our business\" and Part I, Item 3. \"LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\"",
            "We utilize certain technology, including hardware and software, that we license from third parties. Most of these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses. To date, the cost and terms of these licenses individually has not been material to our business. There can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or inability to maintain, existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products and services could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, and could harm our business.",

            "If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly.",
            "Our success depends on acquiring new customers, and retaining and selling additional services to existing customers.",
            "Our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase revenue generated from sales of our cloud software solutions to business customers, including small and mid-size businesses (SMBs) as well as mid-market and larger enterprises. To increase our revenue, we must add new customers and encourage existing customers to continue their subscriptions (on terms favorable to us), increase their usage of our services, and/or purchase additional services from us. For customer demand and adoption of our cloud communications solutions to grow, the quality, cost and feature benefits of these services must compare favorably to those of competing services. For example, our cloud unified communications and contact center services must continue to evolve so that high-quality service and features can be consistently offered at competitive prices. As our target markets mature, or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or more differentiated products or services that compete or are perceived to compete with ours, we may be unable to renew or extend our agreements with existing customers or attract new customers, or new business from existing customers, on favorable terms, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.",
            "The rate at which our existing customers purchase any new or enhanced services we may offer depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the importance of these additional features and services to our customers, the quality and performance of our cloud communications solutions, and the price at which we offer them. If our customers react negatively to our new or enhanced service offerings, such as our recently launched X Series suite of services, or our efforts to upsell are otherwise not as successful as we anticipate, our business may suffer. Our sales strategies must also continue to evolve and adapt as our market matures, for example through the offering of additional customer self-service tools and automation for the SMB sector and the development of new and more sophisticated sales channels that leverage the strengths of our partners. In addition, marketing and selling new and enhanced features and services may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales and marketing efforts that may require us to incur additional expenses and negatively impact the results of our operations.",
            "To support the successful marketing and sale of our services to new and existing customers, we must continue to offer high-quality training, implementation, and customer support. Providing these services effectively requires that our customer support personnel have industry-specific technical knowledge and expertise, which may make it difficult and costly for us to locate and hire qualified personnel, particularly in the competitive labor market in Silicon Valley where we are headquartered. Our support personnel also require extensive training on our products and services, which may make it difficult to scale up our support operations rapidly or effectively. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business globally and pursue new mid-market and enterprise customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-implementation issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell additional features and services to existing customers will suffer and our reputation may be harmed.",
            "If the emerging market for cloud communications services does not continue to grow and if we do not increase our market share, our future business could be harmed.",
            "The market for cloud communications services is evolving rapidly and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants. As is typical of a rapidly evolving industry, the demand for and market acceptance of, cloud communications services is uncertain.Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of cloud communications services as a replacement for legacy on-premise systems. Many larger organizations have invested substantial technical and financial resources and personnel to integrate legacy on-premise communications systems into their businesses and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to cloud communications services such as ours. It is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution, the future growth rate and size of the cloud communications service market, or the entry of competitive products and services. The expansion of the cloud communications services market depends on a number of factors, including the refresh rate for legacy on-premise systems, cost, performance and perceived value associated with cloud communications services, as well as the ability of providers of cloud communications solutions to address security, stability and privacy concerns. If we or other cloud communications service providers experience security incidents, loss of client data, disruptions in service or other problems, the market for cloud communications services as a whole, including our services, may be harmed. If the demand for cloud communications services fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, it could significantly harm our business.",
            "Our success in the cloud communications market depends in part on developing and maintaining effective distribution channels. If we fail to develop and maintain these channels, it could harm our ability to increase our revenues.",
            "A portion of our revenue is generated through our direct sales. This channel is driven largely by sales agentsincluding inside and field-based sales agentswho market and sell our services products and services to customers. Our future success requires continuing to develop and maintain a successful direct sales organization that identifies and closes a significant portion of sales opportunities in the market for cloud communications services. If we fail to do so, or if our sales agents are not successful in their sales efforts, we may be unable to meet our revenue growth targets.",
            "A portion of our business revenue is generated through indirect channel sales. These channels consist of master agents, independent software vendors (ISVs), system integrators, value-added resellers (VARs), and service providers. We typically contract directly with the end customer and use these channel partners to identify, qualify and manage prospects throughout the sales cyclealthough we also have arrangements with a number of partners who resell our services to their own customers, with whom we do not contract or contract only to a limited extent. These channels may generate an increasing portion of our revenue in the future. Our continued success requires continuing to develop and maintain successful relationships with these channel partners and increasing the portion of sales opportunities that they refer to us. If we fail to do so, or if our channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, we may be unable to meet our revenue growth targets.",
            "As we increase sales to enterprise customers, our average sales cycle has become longer and more challenging.",
            "We currently derive a majority of our revenues from sales of our cloud software solutions to mid-market and larger enterprises, and we believe that increasing our sales to these customers is key to our future growth. Our sales cycle, which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale to that customer, is often lengthy and unpredictable for larger enterprise customers. Many of our prospective enterprise customers do not have prior experience with cloud-based communications and, therefore, typically spend significant time and resources evaluating our solutions before they purchase from us. Similarly, we typically spend more time and effort determining their requirements and educating these customers about the benefits and uses of our solutions. Enterprise customers also tend to demand more customizations, integrations and additional features than SMB customers. As a result, we may be required to divert more sales and engineering resources to a smaller number of large transactions than we have in the past, which means that we will have less personnel available to support other sectors, or that we will need to hire additional personnel, which would increase our operating expenses.",
            "It is often difficult for us to forecast when a potential enterprise sale will close, the size of the customer's initial service order and the period over which the implementation will occur, any of which may impact the amount of revenue we recognize or the timing of revenue recognition. Enterprise customers may delay their purchases from one quarter to another as they assess their budget constraints, negotiate early contract terminations with their existing providers or wait for us to develop new features. Any delay in closing, or failure to close, a large enterprise sales opportunity in a particular quarter or year could significantly harm our projected growth rates and cause the amount of new sales we book to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We also may have to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the customer's technical or implementation requirements have been met.",
            "In some cases, we may enter into a contract with a large enterprise customer, such as a preferred vendor agreement, that has little or no minimum purchase commitment but establishes the terms on which the customer's affiliates, clients or franchisees (as the case may be) may order services from us in the future. We may expend significant time and resources becoming a preferred vendor without booking significant sales from the opportunity until months or years after we sign the initial agreement. If we are unsuccessful in selling our services to the prospective purchasers under these agreements, we may not ",
            "recognize revenue in excess of the expenses we incur in pursuing these opportunities, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.",
            "We face significant risks in implementing and supporting the services we sell to mid-market and larger enterprises and, if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our recurring service revenue may not grow at the rate we expected, and our business and results of operations could be harmed.",
            "We have a limited history of selling our services to larger businesses and have experienced, and may continue to experience, new challenges in configuring and providing ongoing support for the solutions we sell to large customers.",
            "Larger customers' networks are often more complex than those of smaller customers, and the configuration of our services for these customers generally require participation from the customers information technology (IT) team.There is no guarantee that the customer will make available to us the necessary personnel and other resources for a successful configuration of services. The lack of local resources may prevent us from properly configuring our services for the customer, which can in turn adversely impact the quality of services that we deliver over our customers' networks, and/or may result in delays in the implementation of our services. This may create a public perception that we are unable to deliver high quality of service to our customers, which could harm our reputation and make it more difficult to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Moreover, larger customers tend to require higher levels of customer service and individual attention (including periodic business reviews and in-person visits, for example), which may increase our costs for implementing and delivering services. If a customer is unsatisfied with the quality of services we provide or the quality of work performed by us or a third party, we may decide to incur costs beyond the scope of our contract with the customer in order to address the situation and protect our reputation, which may in turn reduce or eliminate the profitability of our contract with the customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our larger customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, could harm our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.",
            "We also face challenges building and training an integrated sales force capable of addressing the services and features of our comprehensive service suite, as well as a staff of expert engineering and customer support personnel capable of addressing the full range of implementation and configuration issues that tend to arise more frequently with larger customers. Also, we have only limited experience in developing and managing sales channels and distribution arrangements for larger businesses. If we fail to effectively execute the sale, configuration and ongoing support of our services to mid-market and larger enterprises, our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base could be materially and adversely affected.",
            "Intense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue growth and increasing or maintaining profitability and cause us to incur losses, which could harm our business.",
            "The cloud communications industry is competitive, and we expect it to become increasingly competitive in the future. We may also face competition from companies in adjacent or overlapping industries.",
            "In connection with our unified communication services, we face competition from other providers of cloud communication services, such as RingCentral, Zoom, Fuze, Vonage, Dialpad, Nextiva and Shoretel (acquired by Mitel in 2017). In connection with our cloud contact center services, we face competition from other providers of cloud and premise-based contact center software services, such as NICE/inContact, Five9 and Interactive Intelligence.",
            "In addition, because many of our target customers have historically purchased communications services from incumbent telephone companies along with legacy on-premises communication equipment, we compete with these customers' existing providers. These competitors include, for example, AT&amp;T, CenturyLink, Comcast and Verizon Communications in the United States, as well as local incumbent communications providers in the international markets where we operate, such as Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, America Movil and Deutsche Telekom, all in conjunction with on-premises hardware solutions from companies like Avaya, Cisco and Mitel. We may face competition from large Internet and cloud service companies such as Google Inc., Amazon Inc., Oracle Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, any of which might launch a new cloud-based business communications service, expand its existing offerings or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future.",
            "Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and brand awareness, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. They also may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. Our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that present a more differentiated or better integrated product and services to customers. Increased competition could require us to lower our prices, reduce our sales revenue, lower our gross profits or cause us to incur losses and/or cause us to lose market share. In addition, many of our customers are not subject to long-term contractual commitments and have the ability to switch from our services to our competitors' offerings on relatively short notice. Given the significant price competition in the markets for our services, we may be at a disadvantage compared with those competitors who have substantially greater resources than ",
            "us or may otherwise be better positioned to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure. The adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust our expenses to compensate for such shortfall. Announcements, or expectations, as to the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors or us could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products and services, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.",
            "The market for cloud software solutions is subject to rapid technological change, and we depend on new product and service introductions in order to maintain and grow our business, including in particular our recently launched X Series service line.",
            "We operate in an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and services, and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully in this emerging market, we must continue to design, develop, manufacture, and sell highly scalable new and enhanced cloud software solutions products and services that provide higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost. If we are unable to develop new products and services that address our customers' needs, to deliver our cloud software solution applications in one seamless integrated service offering that addresses our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our products and services in a timely manner, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our services. Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. Access and use of our products and services is provided via the cloud, which, itself, has been disruptive to the previous premises-based model.",
            "If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver communications and collaboration solutions services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete.",
            "If we are unable to develop new features and services internally due to factors such as competitive labor markets, high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, many of our competitors have historically spent a greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors' research and development programs. In addition, there is no guarantee that our research and development efforts will succeed, or that our new products and services will enable us to maintain or grow our revenue or recover our development costs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources, to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors and to successfully monetize our research and development efforts could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.",
            "We launched our new service line, branded \"X Series,\" in July 2018. We market X Series as an array of packaged offerings (designated X2, X4, etc.), which start at the most basic version of our unified communications solution, and add engagement capabilities at each new level, with the top-tier X Series packages combining unified communications and contact center services into a single offering. Customer demand for our X Series offerings will depend on a number of factors, including, for example, factors inherent to the product itself, such as quality of service, reliability, feature availability, and ease of use; and factors relating to our ability to implement, support and market and sell the service effectively. More fundamentally, the success of X Series may depend on whether the market for unified communications, collaborations and contact center services is trending towards convergence of these three solutions into a single system, as we are predicting. We cannot be certain that this market trend will occur according to the timeline we are expecting, or at all. For example, if the various components of our service were to become commoditized and standardized in a way that diminishes the benefits of a single platform for customers, there may be less demand for a unified suite of services like X Series. Low customer demand could make it more difficult for us to win the business of new customers or gain additional business from existing customers, either of which in turn could cause our service revenue to grow more slowly than we expect, or to remain flat or even decrease in future periods.",
            "We have a history of losses and are uncertain of our future profitability.",
            "We recorded a net operating loss of approximately $88.7 millionfor the twelvemonths ended March31, 2019and ended the period with an accumulated deficit of approximately $250.3 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near future as we continue to invest in growth.During our fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we intend to increase significantly our investments in sales and marketing (and digital demand generation in particular), and in research and development, among other areas of our business, in order to compete more successfully for the business of companies that are transitioning to cloud communications and otherwise position ourselves to take advantage of long-term revenue-generating opportunities.",
            "As we increase our investments in these areas, we will likewise need to increase our rate of revenue growth in order to generate and sustain operating profitability in future periods.The investments we expect to make in fiscal 2020 and beyond may not generate the returns that we anticipate, which could adversely impact our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to grow revenue and/or achieve profitability in the time period that we expect, or at all.Given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or maintain operating profitability in the future.",
            "Our churn rate may increase in future periods due to customer cancellations or other factors, which may adversely impact our revenue or require us to spend more money to grow our customer base.",
            "Our customers may discontinue their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which typically range from one to four years. In addition, our customers may renew for lower subscription amounts or for shorter contract lengths. We may not accurately predict cancellation rates for our customers. Our cancellation rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer usage, pricing changes, number of applications used by our customers, customer satisfaction with our service, the acquisition of our customers by other companies, the availability of alternative technologies, and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or decrease the amount they spend with us, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.",
            "Because of churn, we must acquire new customers on an ongoing basis to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. If our churn rate increases, we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted, our revenue could decrease and our net loss could increase.",

In addition, a single, protracted service outage or a series of service disruptions, whether due to our services or those of our carrier partners, may result in a sharp increase in customer cancellations.",
            "Due to the length of our sales cycle, especially in adding new mid-market and larger enterprises as customers, we may also experience delays in acquiring new customers to replace those that have terminated our services. Such delays would be exacerbated if general economic conditions worsen. An increase in churn, particularly in challenging economic times, could have a negative impact on the results of our operations.",

            "As usage of our cloud software solutions by mid-market and larger enterprises expands and as customers continue to integrate our services across their enterprises, we are required to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating our products and applications across our technology platform, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. To the extent we increase our customer base and as our customers gain more experience with our services, the number of users and transactions managed by our services, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our service is being accessed, and the volume of communications managed by our services have in some cases, and may in the future, expand rapidly. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and services and regulatory compliance, to serve our growing customer base. Any failure or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our cloud software solutions to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. These system upgrades and the expansion of our support and services have been and will continue to be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention and increasing our operating expenses. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure and information technology systems. There are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems and we cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all.

We leverage the infrastructure of third-party network service providers to provide telephone numbers, PSTN call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our customers rather than deploying our own network throughout the United States and internationally. This decision has resulted in lower capital and operating costs for our business in the short-term, but has reduced our operating flexibility and ability to make timely service changes. If any of these network service providers cease operations or otherwise terminate the services that we depend on, the delay in switching our technology to another network service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

The occurrence of hardware and software errors, whether caused by our service or products or those of another vendor, may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and services and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses. Under the terms of the \"end-to-end\" service level commitments that we make for the benefit of qualifying customers, we are potentially at risk for service problems experienced by these service providers. Customers who do not qualify for these enhanced service level commitments may nevertheless hold us responsible for these service issues and seek service credits, early termination rights or other remedies.

Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers offer products and services that directly compete with our own offerings, which give them a significant competitive advantage. Some of these broadband providers have stated that they may exempt their own customers from data-caps or offer other preferred treatment to their customers. Other providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our services by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, while others, including some of the largest providers of broadband Internet access services, have committed to not engaging in such behavior.

States have adopted a variety of approaches in attempting to preserve the rules in place prior to the FCC Order.For example, some states have passed narrow laws where rules addressing degradation or otherwise disrupting the provision of broadband internet access services are limited to parties that offer services to government agencies whereas other states have passed laws that apply generally. For example, California passed legislation ",

The intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage, and could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or misappropriated. We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the United States or internationally (where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited), and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours.",
            "We attempt to further protect our proprietary technology and content by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology.",
            "Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or the rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability.",
            "We also may be required to protect our proprietary technology and content in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful, or which we may not pursue in every location. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country, and the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to obtain and maintain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage.",

            "Companies in the cloud communications industry compete aggressively for top talent in all areas of business, but particularly sales and marketing, professional services and engineering, where employees with industry experience, technical knowledge and specialized skill sets are particularly valued. Demand can be expected to increase if cloud communications continues to gain a greater share of the global communications market. Some of our competitors may respond to these competitive pressures by increasing employee compensation, paying more on average than we pay for the same position. Any such disparity in compensation could make us less attractive to candidates as a potential employer, which in turn may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain qualified employees. Training an individual who lacks prior cloud communications experience to be successful in a sales or technical role can take months or even years.",
            "When an employee of 8x8 leaves to work for a competitor, not only are we impacted by the loss of the individual resource, but we also face the risk that the individual will share our trade secrets with the competitor in violation of their contractual and legal obligations to us. Our competitors have in the past and may in the future target their hiring efforts on a particular department, and if we lose a group of employees to a competitor over a short time period, our day-to-day operations may be impaired. While we may have remedies available to us through litigation, they would likely take significant time and expense and divert management attention from other areas of the business.",
            "If we increase employee compensation (beyond levels that reflect customary performance-based and/or cost-of-living adjustments) in response to competitive pressures, we may sustain greater operating losses than we predicted in the near term, and we may not achieve profitability within the timeframe we had expected, or at all.",

            "On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the EU. The timing of the proposed exit is subject to further change; however, it is currently scheduled for as late as October 31, 2019, with a transition period expected to run through December 31, 2020. The political uncertainty that it has raised extends to regulatory uncertainty associated with the proposed exit from the EU. Since the vote to withdraw from the EU, negotiations and arrangements between the United Kingdom, the EU and other countries outside of the EU have been, and will continue to be, complex and time consuming. The potential withdrawal could adversely impact our UK subsidiary, 8x8 UK Limited (previously referred to as Voicenet Solutions Ltd.), and add operational complexities that did not previously exist. Currently, the most immediate impact may be to the relevant regulatory regimes under which 8x8 UK Limited operates, including the offering of communications services, as well as to data privacy regulations. The impact on regulatory regimes remains uncertain. For example, while the United Kingdom government has announced its intent to introduce domestic legislation that would largely reconcile United Kingdom domestic law with many EU laws, including GDPR, it remains unknown what will actually occur it what the departure from the EU may mean with respect to data privacy regulation including its impact on data transfers from the EU to the United Kingdom, and vice versa, as well as data transfers from the United Kingdom to jurisdictions outside of the EU. Also, it remains unclear what impact a United Kingdom withdrawal may have on taxes which may increase the cost of our services sold in the United Kingdom, or reduce our profit margins, or make our services less competitive with traditional communications service providers, or some combination of any of these potential issues.Additionally, the impending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has resulted in significant volatility in the international financial currency markets. Although most of our services revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, we also receive payments in international currencies including the pound and the euro. Like all business that derive revenue in differing currencies, we incur risks with respect to currency translation when there are fluctuations in exchange rates and when the U.S. dollar is valued higher as compared to other currencies.While we cannot predict the impact that an actual exit from the EU will have on 8x8 UK Limited, the potential collateral impact it may have on our operations elsewhere including the U.S., nor its potential impact on our financial results, the United Kingdoms vote to leave the European Union and the uncertainties associated with whether it will be with or without a formal plan has created legal, regulatory, and currency risk that may have a materially adverse impact on our business.",

On an annual and a quarterly basis, there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results, some of which are outside our control. These include, but are not limited to:",
            "Due to these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If any of these were to occur, the price of our common stock would likely decline significantly.",

There is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application, and about the definition of the standards themselves. These standards, as well as audio and video compression standards, continue to evolve. We also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the FCC regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by Underwriters Laboratories, as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries. Standards are frequently modified or replaced. As standards evolve, we may be required to modify our existing services or develop and support new versions of our services. We must comply with certain federal, state and local requirements regarding how we interact with our customers, including marketing practices, consumer protection, privacy, and billing issues, the provision of 9-1-1 or other international emergency services, including location data and the quality of service we provide to our customers. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our communications and collaboration services, subject us to fines or other imposed penalties, or harm the perception and adoption rates of our service, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.",

Similarly, foreign telecommunications regulators may determine that our nomadic emergency calling service does not meet applicable local emergency dialing and location requirements.",

In the United States, two federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the FCC, and various states have enacted laws including, at the federal level, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or TCPA, that restrict the placing of certain telephone calls and texts to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems, prerecorded or artificial voice messages and fax machines. Internationally, we are also subject to similar laws imposing limitations on marketing calls to wireline and wireless numbers and compliance with do not call rules. These laws require companies to institute processes and safeguards to comply with these restrictions.

These IT systems require specialized knowledge for which we have to train new personnel, and if we were to experience an unusual increase in attrition of our IT personnel, we may not be adequately equipped to respond to an IT system failure. These IT systems were developed at a time when we provided services primarily to SMB customers and they may not be able to accommodate the requirements of larger enterprises as effectively as more modern and flexible solutions. Continued reliance on these systems may harm us competitively and impede our efforts to sell to larger enterprises.",

In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our platform. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such software to others on unfavorable license terms.

The taxing authorities may challenge our interpretation of the laws and may assess additional taxes, penalties and interests which could have adverse effects on the results of operations and, to the extent we pass these through to our customers, demand for our services. We currently file more than 1,000 state and municipal tax returns monthly. Periodically, we have received inquiries from state and municipal taxing agencies with respect to the remittance of state or municipal taxes, fees or surcharges.

We adjust our accrual when facts relating to specific exposures warrant such adjustment. This accrued contingent liability is based on our analysis of several factors, including the location where our services are used, our nexus to that jurisdiction for tax purposes, and the taxability of our services under the rules and regulations in each state or municipality (as these may be interpreted by regulatory and judicial authorities from time to time).

We also had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and California tax purposes of approximately $10.1 millionand $11.5 million, respectively. The federal income tax credit carryforwards related to research and development will expire at various dates between 2021 and 2036, while the California income tax credits will carry forward indefinitely. Utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards can become subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of the stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Such an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize the net operating loss or research credit carryforwards. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, the amount of NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of the taxable income in such year. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, the existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our net income (loss) in future periods.

The impact of adopting the new standard on our total revenues and deferred revenue has not been and is not expected to be material. With the adoption of ASC 606 we also adopted ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred CostsContracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a customer contract which, under the old guidance, were expensed as incurred.Adoption of the new standard resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition and deferred commissions.",

The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report larger net losses (or lower net income) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instruments non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.",

From one proprietary cloud technology platform, customers have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics and other services.",

The remainder of our revenues has historically been comprised of professional services revenue and product revenues from the sale of office phones and other equipment.We define a customer as one or more legal entities towhichwe provide services pursuant to a single contractual arrangement. In some cases, we may have multiple billing relationships with a single customer (for example, where weestablishseparate billingaccountsfora parent company and each of its subsidiaries).",
            "Historically, our flagship services have been Virtual Office, a unified communications solution, and Virtual Contact Center, a contact center solution.In 2018, we began selling our 8x8 X Series suite of services, which consist of service plans designated X1, X2, etc., through X8. With 8x8 X Series, we provide both unified communications and contact center functionality from a single platform, with a single interface, in the high-end set of our service plans (X5 through X8).We also offer more basic, cost-efficient unified communications services in X1 through X4. During the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2019, nearly all of our new customers purchased service plans for 8x8 X Series, although we continue to have a significant number of customers subscribed to our Virtual Office and Virtual Contact Center platforms.We have begun migrating these customers from our legacy platforms to 8x8 X Series, and we intend to accelerate the pace of migrations during fiscal years 2020 and 2021.These migrations will require us to incur professional services costs that we may not be able to recover from our customers, and there is also a risk that we will experience an increase in churn.",

We continued to show an increase in our average monthly service revenue per customer (ARPU), which grew to $498, compared with $450 in fiscal 2018, as we are selling more to mid-market and enterprise customers. Service revenue from mid-market and enterprise customers represented 62% of total service revenue and grew 30% over the prior year. We also increased the number of deals where customers purchase our integrated communications and contact center solution, which we have referred to as bundled deals.",

Our business service subscriber base grew from approximately 49,000 customers at the end of fiscal 2018to approximately 52,000 customers on March31, 2019.

On an on-going basis, we evaluate such estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to, revenue recognition, bad debts, returns reserve for expected cancellations, income and sales tax, and litigation and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources.

The transaction price is determined based on the amount we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring the promised services or products to the customer. The transaction price in the contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that represents the relative amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues are recorded based on the transaction price excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales and telecommunication taxes, which are collected on behalf of and remitted to governmental authorities. We usually bill our customers on a monthly basis. Contracts typically range from annual to multi-year agreements with payment terms of net 30 days or less. We occasionally allow a 30-day period to cancel a subscription and return products shipped for a full refund.",

Professional services for configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly or, alternatively, customers may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage their own third-party service providers. Professional services revenue is recognized over time as the services are rendered. When a contract with a customer is signed, we assess whether collection of the fees under the arrangement is probable. We estimate the amount to reserve for uncollectible amounts based on the aging of the contract balance, current and historical customer trends, and communications with its customers. These reserves are recorded as operating expenses against the contract asset (Accounts Receivable). In the normal course of business, we record revenue reductions for customer credits.",

            "Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Goodwill represents the excess fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment and more often if there is an indicator of impairment.",
            "We perform an annual goodwill impairment test on January 1 of each year and during the year, whenever a triggering event for such an assessment is identified. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we changed our product and marketing strategy for the use of DXI's technology and re-assessed the profitability outlook which triggered us testing the recorded goodwill for impairment. First, we estimated the fair value of our three reporting units at the time using the market approach. Under the market approach, we utilized the market capitalization of our publicly-traded shares and comparable company information to determine revenue multiples which were used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on this approach, we determined that there was an indication of impairment only for our DXI reporting unit in the UK as the carrying value including goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. As largely independent cash flows could not be attributed to any assets individually we evaluated DXI's assets and liabilities as one asset group. Then we estimated the fair value of DXI's using discounted cash flow methods to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. The difference between this implied fair value of the goodwill and its carrying value was recorded as impairment. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a non-cash expense for impairment of property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill of $0.3 million, $1.2 million and $8.0 million, respectively, which was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a separate line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.",

In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Once the project has been completed, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in research and development expense on our consolidated statements of operations.",
            "As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book-tax accounting differences for items such as accrued vacation. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance.",
            "Significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable.",
            "In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A significant item of objective negative evidence considered was the historical three-year cumulative pretax loss as of the end of our third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets during that period. As of March 31, 2019, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet.",
            "We estimate our annual effective tax rate at the end of each quarter. In estimating the annual effective tax rate, we consider, among other things, annual pre-tax income, permanent tax differences, the geographic mix of pre-tax income and the application and interpretations of existing tax laws. We record the tax effect of certain discrete items, which are unusual or occur infrequently, in the interim period in which they occur, including changes in judgment about deferred tax valuation allowances. The determination of the effective tax rate reflects tax expense and benefit generated in certain domestic and foreign jurisdictions. However, jurisdictions with a year-to-date loss where no tax benefit can be recognized are excluded from the annual effective tax rate.",

We assess, collect and remit these taxes and report them to municipal, state and federal agencies on a monthly or quarterly basis.

During the year ended March, 31, 2019, we determined that additional sales taxes were probable of being assessed and estimable in multiple states as a result of findings from sales and use tax audits. As of March 31. 2019 we estimated this incremental sales tax liability to be $8.0 million.",

We used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options.

            "During the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company changed its product and marketing strategy for the use of DXI's technology and re-assessed DXI's profitability outlook. This triggered the requirement that the Company test the recorded goodwill for impairment in accordance with ASC 350-20-35. First, the Company estimated the fair value of its threereporting units at the time using the market approach. Under the market approach, the Company utilized the market capitalization of its publicly-traded shares and comparable company information to determine revenue multiples which were used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on this approach, the Company determined that there was an indication of impairment only for its DXI reporting unit, which was within the Company's Europe reporting segment, as the carrying value including goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value. As largely independent cash flows could not be attributed to any assets individually the Company evaluated DXI's assets and liabilities as one asset group. Then the Company estimated the fair value of DXI's asset group using discounted cash flow methods to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. The difference between this implied fair value of the goodwill and its carrying value was recorded as impairment. The outcome of the analysis resulted in a non-cash expense for impairment of property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill of $0.3 million, $1.2 million, $8.0 million, respectively, which was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a separate line item in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.",

Under the Plan, each of our executive officers is eligible to receive bonus awards during each fiscal year tied to the Companys performance in relation to financial targets and, in certain cases, the executives achievement of individual goals.Performance is measured and bonuses are payable on a quarterly basis for the first three quarters of each fiscal year, and there is also an annual measurement of performance and potential bonus payment at the end of the fiscal year.During the first three quarters of the fiscal year, executive officers are eligible to earn bonus payments in amounts ranging from 0% to 100% of the executive officers quarterly target bonus amount (which is 25% of such executive officers full year target bonus amount).During the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year, executive officers are eligible to earn bonus payments in amounts ranging from 0% to 200% of each executive officers annual target bonus amount (which is such executive officers full year target bonus amount), less any bonus amounts paid to such executive officers during the first three quarters of the fiscal year.If the Company performs below a minimum threshold during any quarter or the full fiscal year, bonuses are not payable to executive officers for such period.For our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the bonus target for each quarter and full year is based 100% on the Companys performance in relation to one or more financial target(s).For all other executive officers, the bonus target for each quarter and full year will be based on a combination of Company performance in relation to financial target(s) and achievement of individual goals.For all executive officers in fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, the Company financial performance target is a revenue-based target.",
